"Biggs, M","Biggs, M",Strikes as forest fires: Chicago and Paris in the late nineteenth century,"Historians have persistently likened strike waves to wildfires, avalanches, and epidemics. These phenomena are characterized by a power-law distribution of event sizes. This kind of analysis is applied to outbreaks of class conflict in Chicago from 1881 to 1886. Events are defined as individual strikes or miniature strike waves; size is measured by the number of establishments or workers involved. In each case, events follow a power law spanning two or three orders of magnitude. A similar pattern is found for strikes in Paris from 1890 to 1899. The ""forest fire"" model serves to illustrate the kind of process that can generate this distribution.",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,2005,110,,,SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY; UNITED-STATES; COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR; THRESHOLD MODELS; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; NATURAL HAZARDS; CLASS ALLIANCE; DIFFUSION; LABOR; NETWORKS,,34,34,1,14,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0002-9602,,,AM J SOCIOL,Am.

Because there are differences in the way power is constituted at the transnational and national levels, theories of national political opportunity structures cannot be directly mapped onto the transnational level. The author describes three primary dimensions of political opportunity structure at the transnational level that explain how power is established: (1) the constitution of transnational actors and interests, (2) the definition and recognition of transnational rights, and (3) adjudication at the transnational level. The case of NAFTA suggests that while the emergence of national social movements requires nation-states, global governance institutions can play a pivotal role in the development of transnational social movements.",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,2005,111,,,INTERNATIONALISM; GLOBALIZATION; PERSPECTIVE,,72,72,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0002-9602,1537-5390,,AM J SOCIOL,Am.

Examining the influence of the US. old-age pension movement, which involved millions of people, this article appraises the mediation model using state-level data from the 1930s and 1940s on Old Age Assistance-the main support for the aged at the time-and a Senate vote for generous senior citizens' pensions in 1939. Our models control for other potential influences, notably public opinion, which is often ignored in empirical studies and sometimes claimed to be responsible for causal influence mistakenly attributed to challengers.

Our analysis provides evidence for direct influence of visibility of the organization and its main issue on membership support, while membership support does not influence visibility of an SMO and its issue. Furthermore, an SMO's media visibility is negatively affected by the visibility of other SMOs within the same sector.

By comparing subsets of local organizations in terms of their geographic scope, degree of professionalization, and tactical repertoires, we identify important patterns. First, locally oriented organizations that focus on a neighborhood, city, or county are more likely to be affiliated with a national organization than regional or state organizations, but they are less likely to participate in coalitions than groups working at the regional or state level. Second, organizations relying on a mixture of volunteers and professionals are more formalized and report higher levels of success at mobilizing people than those that rely exclusively on volunteers or professionals. However, groups that are volunteer-based are more likely to engage in partisan activity and have diverse environmental philosophies, but less likely to use conventional advocacy tactics like lobbying and less likely to have a nonprofit tax status. Finally, organizations engaging in disruptive and routinized protest strategies tend to be more similar to one another than they are to organizations that rely exclusively on moderate tactical repertoires such as lobbying or environmental education.",MOBILIZATION,2005,10,,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS; CIVIL-RIGHTS-MOVEMENT; RESOURCE MOBILIZATION; NEWSPAPER COVERAGE; POLITICAL-PROCESS; SELECTION BIAS; ROOTS; MISSISSIPPI; STRATEGY; PROTEST,,65,66,0,31,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,JUN,,991EX,WOS:000233796200002,13,5.0769229

Overall, the ideology was not fundamentally altered or adapted, but indigenized by local activists through the use of local symbols. More deep-rooted change was not necessary for two reasons: First, in the pre-handover moment, rights arguments derived political currency from their association with an international community.

This article reports a pilot study of the values and norms that guide the global justice movement's organizational choices based upon focus groups and in-depth interviews with participants in various Italian social forums. Deliberative democracy, which emphasizes participation and the quality of communication, is particularly relevant for a multifaceted, heterogeneous movement that incorporates many social, generational, and ideological groups as well as movement organizations from different countries. The global justice movement-a ""movement of movements"" according to some activists-comprises a dense network of movement organizations, often the product of previous protest cycles. It builds upon past experiences of organizational institutionalization, but also upon reflexive criticisms of it. These networks of networks provide important resources, but also pose challenges for participation and internal communication. The activists in our study addressed these challenges by building an organizational culture that stressed diversity rather than homogeneity; subjectivity, rather than obedience to organizational demands; transparency, even at the cost of effectiveness; open confrontations oriented to consensus building over efficient decision making; and ""ideological contamination"" rather than dogmatism.

At the same time, Northern groups were significantly more likely to report only regional ties. Environmental and women's organizations were the most likely to maintain only regional ties while economic justice and human rights organizations were the most likely to report cross-regional ties.

Confronting a number of hypotheses derived from this theoretical framework with original data on the extreme right's claim making in five European countries (the Netherlands, Britain, France, Germany, and Switzerland), we show how political-institutional and cultural-discursive opportunities account for differences in the extent, forms, and content of xenophobic and extreme-right claim making. Our study shows that national configurations of citizenship affect in significant ways the mobilization of the extreme right, both directly and indirectly. More precisely, our two-country comparison confirms the hypothesis that the claim making of the extreme right depends on a specific political opportunity structure formed by the combination of discursive opportunities deriving from the prevailing model of citizenship and by the political space made available by mainstream parties for far-right mobilization.",MOBILIZATION,2005,10,,,ETHNIC-MINORITIES; WESTERN-EUROPE; NEWSPAPER DATA; GERMANY; MOVEMENTS; VALIDITY; PARTIES; PROTEST,,25,25,1,23,"SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV, DEPT SOCIOLOGY",SAN DIEGO,"5500 CAMPANILE DR, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,FEB,,991EW,WOS:000233796100009,13,1.9230769

Social movement scholars have tended to focus on activists' instrumental assessments of organizational forms' costs and benefits or on activists' efforts to balance instrumental calculations with a commitment to ideological consistency. Neither explanation is adequate. Organizational forms, like strategies, tactics, and targets, are often appealing for their symbolic associations, and especially, their association with particular social groups. The article fleshes out this dynamic through a case study of the rise and fall of participatory democracy in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Contrary to standard explanations for SNCC activists' repudiation of consensus-based and nonhierarchical decision making in the mid-1960s, I show that participatory democracy was abandoned when it came to be seen as ideological, oriented to personal self transformation, and-no coincidence-as white.

Here, we use the 2002-2003 movement against the impending war in Iraq to refocus analytical attention and sharpen theory on social movement coalitions. We contend that external circumstances, or political opportunities, are critically important factors that affect the propensity of social movement organizations to cooperate in common cause. Further, we contend that cooperation among groups can best be seen as variable, rather than dichotomous, and argue that political context affects the extent of cooperation among cooperating groups. We examine the importance of political context through a comparison of the first and second Gulf Wars. The decision of social movement organizations to join a coalition is akin to the process whereby individuals join social movements, involving an assessment of costs, benefits, and identity. As the political context changes, the costs and benefits are assessed differently and, for this reason, actively engaged coalitions are difficult to sustain over a long period as circumstances change. By looking at the antiwar movement generally, and the Win Without War coalition in particular, we show that cooperation was born in the second Gulf War out of the political opportunities presented by the George W.

Accordingly, there are four key characteristics of the movement society: (1) over time expansion of protest; (2) over time diffusion of protest; (3) over time institutionalization of protest; and (4) over time institutionalization of state responses to protest Using newly available data on over 19,000 protest events occur-ring in the US. between 1960 and 1986, we evaluate these four claims. Our findings suggest that movement society scholars are correct in some respects: the size of protest events has grown over time, the percentage of events at which at least one social movement organization is present has increased over time, the number of distinct protest claims has increased over time, and violent forms of protest policing have decreased over time. However, our findings call into question other movement society claims: the number of protests has declined over time, fewer organizations were present at each protest event over time, fewer new groups initiated events over time, fewer new claims emerged over time, and there was more significant activity by groups on the right in the 1960s and 1970s than expected.

Drawing on social movement theories about the precipitants of mobilization, we examine the extent to which city-level contextual factors, and their change over time, affect variation in the frequency of homeless mobilization across 17 of these cities.

Analyses, which rely on TextAnalyst, highlight semantic networks of thematic content from principal white supremacist websites, and delineate patterns and thematic associations relative to the three requisites of social movement culture denoted in recent research - namely identity, interpretational framing of cause and effect, and political efficacy. Our results suggest that nationalism, religion and definitions of responsible citizenship are interwoven with race to create a sense of collective identity for these groups, their members and potential recruits. Moreover, interpretative frameworks that simultaneously identify threatening social issues and provide corresponding recommendations for social action are employed. Importantly, and relative to prior work, results show how the interpretation of problems, their alleged causes and the call to action are systematically linked.

Contrary to assumptions in popular discourse, wefind a continued importance of the state and limited importance of global economic integration in determining participation in transnational associations. But while ties to the global economy do not significantly impact participation, a country's links to global institutions enhance opportunities for transnational activism. Rich countries' citizens are more active transnationally, but low-income countries with strong ties to theglobalpolity are also more tied to global activist networks.

This logic is based on the observation that each succeeding stage of the legislative process has increasingly stringent rules and becomes more consequential. This logic unevenly distributes the influence of social movements across the legislative process. Social movements should have less influence at later stages where stringent requirements are more likely to exhaust limited resources and where the consequentiality of action will cause legislators to revoke their support. We apply the theory to a study of state-level woman suffrage legislation.

Although scholars have focused increasingly on these large protest events and the transnational social movements that play a role organizing them, information about the protesters remains scant. We address this research gap by analyzing survey data collected from a random sample of protesters at five globalization protests in three countries. By disaggregating protesters from the local area and protesters who traveled to the protest event, the role that organizations play becomes clear: SMOs mobilize non-local participants and coordinate travel to protest events. These data also suggest answers to the broader questions that have emerged about global civil society. In contrast to the expectations in recent scholarship, we find very few protesters came from outside of the countries in which the protests were taking place. Instead, we conclude that SMOs use the Internet to connect domestically grounded activists to transnational struggles and to mobilize them to participate in large-scale protest events. In other words, organizations do, indeed, matter in the globalization movement and have significantly expanded the protesting population beyond local citizens.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2005,52,,,,,65,66,2,15,UNIV CALIF PRESS,BERKELEY,"C/O JOURNALS DIVISION, 2000 CENTER ST, STE 303, BERKELEY, CA 94704-1223 USA",0037-7791,,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

These strategies invoked a rhetoric of moral reasoning in order to promote the entitlement of non-citizens to remain eligible for public benefits. Utilizing social movement framing perspectives, I examine the claims-making strategies that appeal to common beliefs about aging, frailty, disability, and the obligation of the United States to its veterans. However, collective action frames comprised moral constructions of human rights for only specific immigrant groups that lost specific benefits. I consider the broader implications of such findings for immigrant and welfare rights movements.

However, in a social constructionist framework, victimization is an interactional, discursive process rather than simply an objective fact about some persons or groups.

This article explores these positive implications. It is based on a study of published accounts of both parents accused of past sexual abuse by adult children and ""retractors,"" one-time accusers who now reject their abuse ""memories"" and have withdrawn the abuse allegations they previously made.

Sleepiness originally described a benign, naturally occurring corporeal moment, a precursor to sleep. Increasingly, however, a new and disturbing meaning of somnolence is found in a juncture of medical and epidemiological research, social movements, and popular culture. Alongside the idea that sleepiness is a tranquil promise of repose is another, emerging truth. Sleepiness, we are told, is hazardous to self and others, and, importantly, it is each person's responsibility to resist this seductive call of the body. How, we ask, is a private, routinely occurring state of partial consciousness deprivatized, linked to public health vernaculars, and transformed into a reprobate condition? This alternative, disturbing truth about sleepiness is shown to be emerging from several disparate, seemingly unrelated caches of scientific studies, social movement literatures, magazines and newspapers, and web sites. The ideas of Michel Foucault, who pioneered the contemporary study of discourse, are shown to be particularly apropos to this inquiry, though not without some modification to make them more amenable to a contemporary society shaped increasingly by what Zygmunt Bauman calls ""liquid modernity.""",SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY,2005,75,,,DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; MEDICAL SOCIOLOGY; APNEA; IMPAIRMENT; HEALTH,,22,22,1,10,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0245,,,SOCIOL INQ,Sociol.

To the extent that it provides room for the existence of collective actions, hegemony is expansive; yet, because it is not total, the condition for the existence of counter-hegemonies that call to question its ""essentials"" also exists. The case of grassroots environmental justice organizations in the United States (GEJOs) that deal with first-order quality of life issues falls within the province of the latter dynamics. GEJOs deal with an issue limited in scope, viz., environmental crisis; however, their movement participants have contested the multiple dimensions of existing hegemony. These organizations, as total counter-hegemonies, have challenged the political, economic, intellectual, and cultural orders of the American society. The interest in distributive justice, participatory democracy, public-oriented scientific endeavor, and a well-ordered cultural realm based on a universal good sense are the fundamental elements of an alternative hegemony manifest or latent in the discursive formations and practices of GEJOs.

Political art that is for sale call change because the intermediary (the organization connecting producers and buyers) becomes less or more politically conservative, develops a precarious financial situation, grows more afraid of repression, and has the power to enforce the changes it desires; because the original buyer,,; are replaced with new buyers with different motivations; and because new artists with new ideas begin making the art, one artist in the group produces something different and the idea spreads, artists censor themselves, and artists have new experiences or learn about new events. Through these sources of change, international social movements, local and international political and economic developments, and global institutions impact the art. Meanings attached to the art by the different parties (intermediaries, buyers, and artists) and class differences between artists and intermediaries are also important in facilitating change. These findings, based as they are oil political art made in a repressive context, not only contribute to our understanding of artistic evolution bill they help correct the bias in the sociology of art toward ""art"" made in democratic countries of the ""First World."" They are not just applicable to authoritarian regimes but also to art by politicized minority groups in democratic contexts, and to other cultural products such as newspapers, magazines, documentaries, and books.",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,2005,48,,,POPULAR-MUSIC; MOVEMENTS; DEMOCRACY; INDUSTRY; CHILE,,3,3,2,11,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,BERKELEY,"C/O JOURNALS & DIGITAL PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2000 CENTER ST, STE 303, BERKELEY, CA 94704-1223 USA",0731-1214,,,SOCIOL PERSPECT,Sociol.

The framing paradigm provides a basis for analyzing how activist rhetoric shapes interpretations of opportunities and grievances among social movement participants to alter the goals and intensity of grassroots protest. As the land struggle demonstrates, leaders communicating with grassroots participants in a process of struggle may, over time, underemphasize shifts occurring in some dimensions of political opportunities, while framing more stable dimensions as having changed. They may also alter their framing of grievances.",SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY,2005,46,,,COLLECTIVE ACTION FRAMES; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; MOBILIZATION; PROTEST; DEMOCRACY; POLICY,,14,14,0,7,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0038-0253,,,SOCIOL QUART,Sociol.

"Coy, PG; Hedeen, T","Coy, PG; Hedeen, T",A stage model of social movement co-optation: Community mediation in the United States,"The community mediation movement in the United States arose in the late 1970s as an alternative to a formalized justice system that was perceived to be costly, time consuming, and unresponsive to individual and community needs. Community mediation advocates also valued community training, social justice, volunteerism, empowerment, and local control over conflict resolution mechanisms. But over the past quarter century, community mediation has become increasingly institutionalized and has undergone various degrees of co-optation in its evolving relationship with the court system. Drawing on the literatures of dispute resolution, co-optation, and social movements, we analyze the evolution of community mediation and identify the degrees and dimensions of its co-optation. Thus, we develop a four-stage model of co-optation as it has occurred within the community mediation movement, identifying multiple steps in each stage. This analysis facilitates greater understanding of specific events, particular processes, and individual decisions and dilemmas that mediation activists face in their working relationships with their communities and the formal legal system. Further, scholars studying similar processes in other social movements may find that this stage model of co-optation, in whole or in part, is useful to their analyses of other movements.",SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY,2005,46,,,INSTITUTIONAL ISOMORPHISM; ORGANIZATIONS; CONSEQUENCES; IDENTITY,,37,40,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0038-0253,,,SOCIOL QUART,Sociol.

The impact of collective action frames, feelings of efficacy, social network ties, and home schooling motivations are considered. Regression models are employed in an analysis of original survey data from an organized group of Southern California homeschoolers. Home schooling motivations are most salient in determining whether one interprets their activities as part of a larger movement. Social network tie indicators are largely unimportant in the models. The findings highlight the important role of organizational affiliation and integration. Homeschoolers without affiliations and those who are less integrated into their support organizations are not likely to feel as if they are part of a larger movement. Organizational integration - specifically attitudinal affinity - also appears to make home schooling parents become more narrowly focused upon their own children rather than the welfare of all children.

"Walder, AG","Walder, Andrew G.",Ambiguity and choice in political movements: The origins of Beijing Red Guard factionalism,"Theories about political movements typically posit models of actor choice that contain untested static assumptions about context. Short-run changes in these contexts - induced by rapid shifts in the properties of political institutions - can alter choices and actors' interests, rapidly transforming the political landscape. China's Red Guard Movement of 1966 - 68 is a case in point. A generation of scholarship has attributed its violent factionalism to the opposed interests of different status groups. New evidence about the origins of the movement in Beijing's universities indicates that to the contrary, factions emerged when activists in similar structural positions made opposed choices in ambiguous contexts. Activists subsequently mobilized to defend earlier choices, binding them to antagonistic factions. Rapid shifts in the contexts for political choice can alter prior connections between social position and interests, generating new motives and novel identities. Close attention to these contextual mechanisms can yield novel accounts of the nature and origins of political movements.",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,2006,112,,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; PARIS COMMUNE; ACTIVISM; TIES; MOBILIZATION; INSURRECTION; RECRUITMENT; REBELLION; NETWORKS; ELITE,,17,17,0,14,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0002-9602,,,AM J SOCIOL,Am.

Merging insights from social movement theory, the sociology of law, and law and society scholarship, the author argues that law is a type of "" master frame,"" and that mobilizing law's "" constitutive"" symbols and categories is a central, yet routinely overlooked, way in which challengers frame their grievances, identity, and objectives. This study systematically explores legal framing processes through historical-narrative analysis of the women's movement and the debate over protective labor laws in the 1960s. Historical evidence suggests that reciprocal transformations in the women's movement and equal employment law were largely attributable to a symbolic framing contest between competing cultural representations of gender (""protective"" vs. ""equal"" treatment) and that this contest was waged in explicitly legal terms.",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,2006,111,,,CIVIL-RIGHTS-ACT; POLITICAL-PROCESS THEORY; HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY; RESOURCE MOBILIZATION; SEX-DISCRIMINATION; RATIONAL CHOICE; LAW; EXPLANATION,,60,61,1,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0002-9602,,,AM J SOCIOL,Am.

These mobilization paths arose from the patterned intersections of individual-level biographies, networks, and situational contexts. The implications of these findings extend beyond studies of revolutionary activism to analyses of microlevel mobilization in general.

"Luders, J","Luders, J",The economics of movement success: Business responses to civil rights mobilization,"This article explores why movements are successful in obtaining concessions from economic actors. While social movement theorists have suggested that economic actors weigh the costliness of protests, the author considers the vulnerability of movement targets to both the cost of disruptions in routine transactions and the cost of conceding to movement demands. By addressing the magnitude of these costs and their interaction, the author derives an economic opportunity structure to predict the receptivity of economic actors to movement demands and the likely struggles among them over the decision to yield. Also, this cost-assessment approach reveals patterns of vulnerability across economic sectors to the costs of disruptive mobilization. The author tests this analysis based on case studies of the responses of economic actors to civil rights mobilization in the 1960s in five Southern localities. These cases depict how the character of protest and variation in the configuration of business communities defined the range of movement outcomes from relatively swift accommodation to persistent resistance.",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,2006,111,,,POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY; PROTEST; MISSISSIPPI; POLICY; TRADE; SOUTH; POWER,,50,50,35,157,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0002-9602,,,AM J SOCIOL,Am.

This question regarding the relationship between global and local thinking goes to the heart of the current globalization debates. This study examines the contrasting responses from the Chinese and Indian women movements to the agenda adopted by the United Nations Fourth World Confirence on Women. The contrast challenges the dominant assumption that global thinking can substitute for local thinking. The article shows how national movements decided for or against international agendas through context-dependent meaning-making processes. The Chinese and Indian movements drew on the international agenda to pursue similar national policy goals. Each reached its decision on the international agenda through a similar sequence of interactions with the government. However due to mediation by nationally unique combinations of political rules and policy-related timing, the two movements attached opposite meanings to the international agenda. The Chinese movement embraced the international agenda and reinterpreted it by emphasizing its difference from the government position; the Indian movement used the international agenda as a surrogate target and rejected it by emphasizing its similarities to the government position.

It does so through a comparative-historical analysis of Stonewall and four events similar to it that occurred in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York in the 1960s. The Stonewall riots were remembered because they were the first to meet two conditions: activists considered the event commemorable and had the mnemonic capacity to create a commemorative vehicle. That this conjuncture occurred in New York in 1969, and not earlier or elsewhere, was a result of complex political developments that converged in this time and place. The success of the national commemorative ritual planned by New York activists depended on its resonance, not only in New York but also in other US. cities. Gay community members found Stonewall commemorable and the proposed parade an appealing form for commemoration. The parade was amenable to institutionalization, leading it to survive over time and spread around the world.

This episode is widely cited in the literature on social movements, but the debate over its explanation remains unresolved-partly because previous research has relied on case studies of a few large cities. The authors use event-history analysis to trace the diffusion of sit-ins throughout the South and to compare cities where sit-ins occurred with the majority of cities where they did not. They assess the relative importance of three channels of diffusion: movement organizations, social networks, and news media. The authors find that movement organizations played an important role in orchestrating protest; what mattered was a cadre of activists rather than mass membership. There is little evidence that social networks acted as a channel for diffusion among cities. By contrast, news media were crucial for conveying information about protests elsewhere. In addition, the authors demonstrate that sit-ins were most likely to occur where there were many college students, where adults in the black community had greater resources and autonomy, and where political opportunities were more favorable.",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2006,71,,,MOBILIZATION; INNOVATION; VIOLENCE; EVENTS; PARTICIPATION; OPPORTUNITIES; STRIKES; HISTORY; GERMANY; PARIS,,108,109,1,60,AMER SOCIOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"1307 NEW YORK AVE NW #700, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4712 USA",0003-1224,,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

It applies Diani's (1996) approach that links categories of master frames with political opportunity structures. The analysis chronicles how political context shaped the evolution of the moveSment's dominant message and traces how political opportunities imparted advantages to a reformist civil rights message that reflected a realignment master frame in early stages of Northern Irish mobilization. Later, changes in political context-police repression, lack of political responsiveness, and countermobilization-rendered reformist political realignments impossible and gave advantages to elements in the civil rights network that stressed the traditional ethnonational divisions and revanchist, antipartitionist messages. Specifically, this article asks how the inclusive and reformist mobilizing messages of the 1960s Northern Irish civil rights movement came about and then reverted to the exclusivist Nationalist message of the 1970s, and how the shifting political opportunities brought about these changes.",MOBILIZATION,2006,11,,,COLLECTIVE ACTION; MOBILIZATION,,26,26,2,12,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,FEB,,067CB,WOS:000239277500005,12,2.1666667

As different actors came to occupy positions of power within the state of Mississippi, they responded differently to relevant audiences and affected the degree to which the council could exercise leverage with the commission to control protest. The analysis focuses on how the state-countermovement ties of ideology and funding changed over time, even though membership overlap between the commission board and the council remained relatively constant. Three relational structures - frustrated, aligned, and stifled - are identified and discussed as influencing the degree to which the council could gain leverage in Mississippi's multilevel state structure where multiple audiences mattered.",MOBILIZATION,2006,11,,,CIVIL-RIGHTS; WAR,,9,9,1,6,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,JUN,,084BN,WOS:000240506700003,12,.75

Popular narratives of social change assign some movements a critical role for promoting change, but ignore the influence of others. Winning acceptance of a preferred narrative of influence is a neglected, but important, social movement outcome. I use disparate stories of movement success in claiming credit to underscore the analytical problem of why some challengers end up deriving credit, both in the short and long term, for their efforts, while others don't. Movement activists and their competitors offer narratives of past influence as a kind of claims-making activity to serve current political goals. In this way, the process of claiming credit is analogous to that of establishing a reputation. I examine contextual factors likely to affect why some social movements, and some social movement actors, may be better positioned or more interested, in promoting a narrative of their own influence than others. I argue that movement factions that place identifiable individuals in prominent positions in institutional politics are more likely to be able to promote their story of influence, but paradoxically this comes with a narrative that emphasizes the importance of mainstream politics.

Regarding national protests in general, the results demonstrate that protests and coercion are closely and dynamically related. Unexpectedly, results show that, overall, protests do not necessarily decrease with coercion but do when no coercion at all is applied. My analysis also uncovers variation in the dynamics of state coercion and protest according to types of dissident groups. Of the groups assessed, workers were particularly active in protest. Farmers were the least active, and the Korean regime responded with the least repressive approach toward them. These findings emphasize the importance of daily subnational data.

Radical Islam, al-Qa'ida and social movement theory","European new social movement (NSM) theory was developed to describe and explain the apparently unique character of the wave of collective action that began in the 1960s and continues to this day. Key characteristics of NSM theory are a post-industrial orientation, middle-class activist core, loose organizational form, use of symbolic direct actions, creation of new identities, and a ""self-limiting radicalism."" The theory's claims to movement innovation were later criticized by many as exaggerated and ahistorical. However, the filtering down of key NSM elements into social movement studies has led to changing definitions of what social movements actually are and opened up new opportunities for the integration of religious movements into the social movements mainstream. Using the case of radical Islam, and with particular reference to the terrorist social movement organization al-Qa'ida, this article argues that drawing on key features of NSM theory should lead to a better understanding of radical Islam as well as a more realistic explanation of its continuing development and transformation.",MOBILIZATION,2006,11,,,MIDDLE-CLASS; TERRORISM,,20,20,4,10,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,FEB,,067CB,WOS:000239277500006,12,1.6666666

These differences can be attributed, in part, to the different citizenship regimes in each country: republican in France; liberal in the U.S.; and ethnonational in Israel. Arguments and practices that seemed sensible in one locale seemed utterly inappropriate in another. Social movements' activists did not manipulate conceptions of citizenship strategically.

One result of repression - backfire - can contribute to the understanding of the conditions under which some repressive events may become transformative for social movements. Three case studies that highlight the processes involved in backfire are examined: the 1930 Salt March in India, in particular the beatings at Dharasana, that mobilized popular support for independence; the 1991 massacre in Dili, East Timor, which stimulated a massive expansion in international support for East Timorese independence; and the arrest of alternative cancer therapist John Richardson in 1972, which led to a huge growth in the U.

Reputational entrepreneurs undercut organizational legitimacy by depicting members with disreputable or radical affiliations as representative of their opponents. These attacks on character must be countered, costing resources and limiting organizational reach. Through reputation work, advocates assert that groups they oppose have a large proportion of stigmatized supporters, are affiliated with prominent disreputable figures, and espouse policies favored by such figures. Such claims direct attention from the substance of the debate, directing attention to the moral stature of claimants. Those attacked must rely on counterstrategies to defend themselves. They deny that disreputables are representative, demonstrating their bona fides by exclusive practices, claim that opposing groups have the same problem, and suggest that stigmatized supporters are agents of their opponents.

The survey includes measures of integration into preexisting social networks and measures of beliefs and sentiments. Most surprisingly, students who attended church frequently were less likely to join the sit-ins, though the presence of activist ministers made protest more likely. Protesters were motivated by strong grievances, for they had an especially negative evaluation of race relations.

Analyses utilize a unique data source describing programmatic activities for 353 independent organizations from a directory compiled by the American Council on Race Relations in 1949, as well as primary historical documents chronicling strategic rationales among leaders of intergroup relations. Findings indicate a pattern of strategic eclecticism, with some grouping of activities around loose strategic orientations in the areas of formal/institutional challenges, community services/organization, and public education. Rationales emphasized efforts to link more and less contentious strategies-both across the movement field and movement phases-suggesting a complementary rather than competitive dynamic.

Building on Bourdieu, Putnam, and the existing literature on social movement leadership, we argue that these movements' leaders possessed ""leadership capital"" having cultural, social, and symbolic components.

Building on recent discussions of repression and mobilization of social movements, a distinction is made between hard and soft repression. These forms of repression are further differentiated into state repression, confrontation with countermovements, and exclusion from the political and social environment. It is argued that all of these forms of repression work simultaneously. Furthermore, it is argued that a climate of soft repression facilitates hard repression. This reasoning is evidenced by material from in-depth interviews with thirty-six activists from the extreme-right movement in the Netherlands. Indeed, all forms of repression are experienced by the interviewees. The way they cope with repression depends on their pathway into activism. Disengagement from the movement appears to be unrelated to repression, but rather due to the daily hassles, interpersonal conflicts, and petty complaints as part of movement activism.",MOBILIZATION,2006,11,,,,,35,35,1,13,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,JUN,,084BN,WOS:000240506700006,12,2.9166667

Distinct from traditional blame-avoidance strategies, protest avoidance occurs when elected officials, facing direct and nearly inescapable blame, attempt to reduce the scope of social mobilization triggered by unpopular reforms. In recent decades, successive French governments have introduced major, unpopular reforms in the field of public pensions, and because of the concentration of state power in France, avoidance of blame was nearly inescapable. Focusing on the 2003 pension reform, we argue that by dividing the labor movement through strategic bargaining, and by launching controversial reforms during or immediately before the summer holiday season, French governments reduced the scope of labor mobilization and facilitated the enactment of these proposals. Beyond the field of social policy, the concept of protest avoidance could shed new light on an understudied phenomenon: the strategies political actors pursue to reduce the scope of social mobilization against them.",MOBILIZATION,2006,11,,,POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY; WELFARE-REFORM; STATE,,14,14,0,6,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,SEP,,097OM,WOS:000241457600006,12,1.1666666

This form of claim making targets the state but is distinct from the fully public and trangressive challenges against the state that are the focus of the dynamics of contention approach. This report traces how episodes of resistant contention track through two key processes - actor constitution and scale shift - as well as many mechanisms that combine in more public contention. Examples from Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Soviet Caucasus, and Spain are reviewed to trace, first, patterns of contentious speech; namely, ""small"" claim making and grievance articulation under conditions of risk. I argue that contentious political talk is fundamental to the process of actor constitution in repressive states. Then I trace how contentious speech is patterned in the form of intellectual circles, cultural groups, dissident groups, and official groups and organizations, many of which function publicly but also privately and contentiously. These boundary-spanning groups are the loci of innovation and identity formation in resistant episodes. Scale shift dynamically occurs with the process of actor constitution, typically taking the form of hit-and-run protests, graffiti, clandestine placements, and event seizures.

However, such work has focused mostly on settings in which activists are relatively free to pursue different identity-based strategies. In contrast, less is known about the strategic use of identity in more repressive contexts, where the expression of certain identities may be curtailed. This paper addresses this issue by examining the ""identity work"" of Jewish resistance fighters in Nazi-occupied Warsaw, Poland. While their resistance was fueled by a strong sense of collective identity, the heavy costs associated with public displays of Jewishness meant that identity also had to be kept hidden in order for the resistance to occur. Unlike the freely chosen, ""harmonic"" identity work that has been described by most research, these activists' work was forced and more dissonant, characterized by the simultaneous amplification and suppression of identity and emotion.

By,focusing on micromobilization contexts, I unpack the interpretive process through which working class collective histories are understood and inflected with particular subjective meanings. Within these contexts, the dynamic interplay between the conditions of work, past cultural contexts, discourse, and collective action affected the way potential union supporters understood the meaning of the movement, and whether or not the union made sense as a vehicle for change. Workers came to understand the meaning of unionism based on the complex interplay between the structural conditions of the workplace, the cultural constructions of past labor-relations regimes, and the discourse and action of the organizing drive itself.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2006,53,,,COLLECTIVE ACTION; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; ACTION FRAMES; CONSTRUCTION; REPERTOIRES; STRATEGIES; DISCOURSE; POLITICS; CULTURE; WORKING,,5,5,1,7,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,BERKELEY,"C/O JOURNALS & DIGITAL PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2000 CENTER ST, STE 303, BERKELEY, CA 94704-1223 USA",0037-7791,,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

Yet, scholars have not examined how the political environment affects the tactical choices of social movement organizations in the media arena. In this article, I analyze how political threats and opportunities affect the media strategies and tactics of two reasonably successful and long-lived social movement organizations on opposite sides of the abortion debate, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) and the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC), from 1980 to 2000. In particular, I examine how political shifts affect the tactics these groups use in response to their allies over time. I find that different social movement organizations respond to political opportunities and threats similarly. In times of political opportunity, groups remain silent on their allies' activities because silence distances their organizations from rancorous public debates and buttresses their political legitimacy. During political threats, groups cooperate with their allies in the media arena but they use public coalition work to advance their own political and media goals. Conceptually, this research broadens how we think about media tactics, which vary far more than scholars currently recognize, and deepens our understanding of coalition work and movement dynamics.

Ethnographic and interview data from a rural Norwegian community describes how people avoided thinking about climate change in part because doing so raised fears of ontological security, emotions of helplessness and guilt, and was a threat to individual and collective senses of identity. In contrast to existing studies that focus on the public's lack of information or concern about global warming as the basis for the lack of public response, my work describes the way in which holding information at a distance was an active strategy performed by individuals as part of emotion management. Following Evitar Zerubavel, I describe this process of collective avoiding as the social organization of denial. Emotions played a key role in denial, providing much of the reason why people preferred to avoid information. Emotion management was also a central aspect of the process of denial, which in this community was carried out through the use of a cultural stock of social narratives that were invoked to achieve ""perspectival selectivity"" and ""selective interpretation.""",SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY,2006,76,,,GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; PERCEPTIONS; IDENTITY,,79,80,2,41,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0245,,,SOCIOL INQ,Sociol.

Based upon documentary and interview data, I demonstrate that Amnesty's decision to work toward the abolition of capital punishment provoked intense internal debate based upon the prevalence within AIUSA at that time of a narrow conception of human rights, concern about the effect of anti-death penalty projects on the group's priorities, and the fear that the carefully crafted image the organization had built would be damaged by anti-death penalty work. The ACLU's endorsement of drug legalization provoked some of the same concerns, but issues of public identity management were far less evident. Instead, internal debates focused on the proper breadth of the organization's anti-prohibitionism.

The theoretical framework employed in this article is constructed by importing two concepts from political process models of social movement action into culturalist accounts, historical environment (or context), and opportunity. This framework allows me to look at how historical environments offer transient openings for the effective construction of counterhegemonic or subversive collective action frames. I argue that opportunity for framing has to do with the intersection between the signification requisites of framing practices, and the systemic features of cultural environments.

Movements frequently deal with problems of reframing and reinterpretation of their messages by mainstream media by trying to build relationships with mainstream media actors. But this is not the only way that movements can gain positive media coverage. This article reveals two little-discussed media strategies that movements may adopt in order to mitigate the problem of how to best get sympathetic news coverage. First, movements can circumvent mainstream media altogether by using alternative media. Second, movements can work to reform the media, thereby changing the rules and structures that govern movement-media relationships. I use data from interviews with participants in the free radio movement to illustrate these two media strategies and how their use helped the movement achieve moderate successes. I argue that control of (or access to) alternative media can help a social movement overcome the difficulties of gaining sympathetic mainstream media coverage. I also argue that the media reform movement, if successful, could further help social movements overcome this problem.

"Bartley, T","Bartley, Tim",Institutional emergence in an era of globalization: The rise of transnational private regulation of labor and environmental conditions,"Why have systems of ""transnational private regulation"" recently emerged to certify corporate social and environmental performance? Different conceptions of institutional emergence underlie different answers to this question. Many scholars argue that firms create certification systems to solve problems in the market-a view rooted in a conception of institutions as solutions to collective action problems. The author develops a different account by viewing institutions as the outcome of political contestation and by analyzing conflict and institutional entrepreneurship among a wide array of actors. Using a comparative case study design, the analysis shows how these arguments explain the formation of social and environmental certification associations. Both theoretical approaches are needed, but strong versions of the market-based approach overlook an important set of dynamics that the author calls the ""political construction of market institutions."" The analysis shows how both problem solving in markets and political contention generate new institutional forms.",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,2007,113,2,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; CONSTRUCTION; POLITICS; MARKETS; CONDUCT; RIGHTS; CODES; STATE; NEOLIBERALISM; CERTIFICATION,176,388,393,10,107,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0002-9602,1537-5390,,AM J SOCIOL,Am.

This variation is explained by a model of path-dependent memory work that is sensitive to how previous memory struggles enable and constrain subsequent uses of historical figures. Specifically, previous struggles produce distinct reputational trajectories that condition the potential utility of different modes of memory work. The cases illustrate two reputational trajectories, which are situated within a broader field of mnemonic possibilities. This article offers a provisional baseline for comparing contested memory projects and supplies a framework for analyzing the opportunities and constraints by which reputational trajectories condition memory work.

Three decades ago, with the paradigmatic shift from psychological to strategic explanations, Weber concept virtually disappeared from scholarship about collective action. Based on an investigation of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, I examine the distinctive structure and capacities of charismatic mobilization. During the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong called on students, workers, and peasants to attack the officials of his own party. Because Mao employed both bureaucratic and charismatic methods of mobilization, this movement offers an opportunity to compare the structural characteristics of the two and evaluate their distinctive capacities. Through a case study of the most prominent Cultural Revolution rebel organization, I demonstrate that the informal structure of charismatic mobilization gave the movement a rule-breaking power that made it highly effective in undermining bureaucratic authority. I then suggest how the concepts of charismatic and bureaucratic mobilization might be used to analyze other social movements and to clarify issues in long-standing debates about the tendency of social movement organizations to become conservative.",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2007,72,3,,RESOURCE MOBILIZATION; MOVEMENT; REVITALIZATION; LEADERSHIP,88,18,18,0,26,AMER SOCIOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"1307 NEW YORK AVE NW #700, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4712 USA",0003-1224,,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

We theorize that the cultural context in which framing takes place moderates the success of movement framing in winning changes in policy. We examine the efforts of organized women, during roughly the first half of the twentieth century, to convince lawmakers to broaden jury laws to give women the opportunity to sit on juries. To examine the combined effect of framing and the discursive opportunities provided by hegemonic legal principles, traditional gender beliefs, gendered political opportunities, opposition framing, and wartime, we use logistic regression. The findings provide substantial evidence that framing influence is moderated by discursive elements in the broader context.

We demonstrate the diffuse and indirect effects of social movements, and also show that the diffusion of social-movement values is often selective-some are retained, while others are discarded. Our empirical site is the Progressive movement and the early thrift industry in California. We draw on social-movement research and organizational theory to argue that a new ideal of thrift, bureaucratized cooperation among strangers, replaced the original idea of thrift, friendly cooperation among neighbors. This shift was possible only after the modernizing temper of Progressivism gave rise to two institutions, the news media and role-model organizations, that made bureaucracy culturally appropriate. The bureaucratization of thrift occurred even though it resulted in a centralization of power which clashed with the Progressive ideal of equitably distributing power Our study provides a compelling example of the fundamental revolution in American social organization in the twentieth century: the replacement of community-based groups by bureaucracies.",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2007,72,,,INSTITUTIONAL SOURCES; ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION; BREWING INDUSTRY; FORMAL-STRUCTURE; POLITICS; CONSEQUENCES; DIFFUSION; DYNAMICS; WOMENS,,69,69,2,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

But for Chinese Protestants, creative outreach strategies can be a substitute for existing relationships and initiate recruitment. In China, public proselytizing is forbidden, religion is rarely mentioned in the media, and direct contact with potential converts is discouraged. To attract strangers, evangelists in China rely on door-to-door proselytizing in the countryside, cultural performances embedded with religious messages in the cities, and one-on-one conversations when the opportunity arises. By contacting targets in the ordinary flow of life and fashioning appeals using resonant language, Protestant recruiters have become adept at attracting non-networked individuals in ""safe-enough"" spaces that appear in the creases of a reforming Leninist regime. At a general level, the analysis suggests that networks sometimes play a smaller role in recruitment than is commonly thought, at least at first, and that social bonds may be as much a result of recruitment as a precondition for it.",MOBILIZATION,2007,12,1,,SOCIAL NETWORKS; FREEDOM SUMMER; CONVERSION; MOVEMENTS; CHRISTIANITY; ACTIVISM; SPACES,82,11,11,3,16,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,MAR,,154ZK,WOS:000245547100005,11,1

These actors spent months preparing the ground before the conflict escalated in late January and early February 2005.

"Vitale, AS","Vitale, Alex S.",The command and control and miami models at the 2004 republican national convention: New forms of policing protests,"With the increase in large contentious demonstrations in the last decade has come a variety of new efforts to explain the tactics used by police. Based on an analysis of how the New York Police Department (NYPD) handled six demonstrations at the 2004 Republican National Convention (RNC), this article argues that the more repressive Miami model of policing has not become the universal norm in policing large protests.

In the case of challengers, we estimate the likelihood a state-level organization is present in any given legislative year. In the case of state actors, we estimate the likelihood a bill passes one legislative house given the presence of a state-level suffrage organization and that a bill has been introduced Mixed signals are apparent in that challengers and legislators respond to the same environmental factors differently. Challengers respond to perceived opportunities far change.

This outcome cannot be explained by either American exceptionalism or by a general decline in activism in the wake of the tragedies of 9/11 and the Iraq War. First comparing expressions of the American and European global justice movements and then turning to original data on social movement organizing in Seattle after 1999, we argue that the weakness of the American global justice movement can be tied to three key factors: (a) a more repressive atmosphere towards transnational protest; (b) a politically inspired linkage between global terrorism and transnational activism of all kinds; and (c) what we call ""social movement spillout."" We further argue that the strongest movement since September 11th-the antiwar movement-exemplifies a broader trend in the United States towards the ""spillout"" of transnational activism into domestic protest.",MOBILIZATION,2007,12,4,,POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY; PROTEST,53,24,25,0,11,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,DEC,,242XH,WOS:000251759000003,11,2.2727273

In response to terrorism, governments throughout the Middle East and North Africa suppressed the civil and political rights of all citizens. This clampdown on civil society transpired on the heels of political reforms in several countries and coincided with the increasing integration of these states into international treaty regimes, signaling a willingness to comply with world standards on human rights. Engaging the literatures on terrorism, world polity, and social movements, I first analyze the relationship between political regime type and movement mobilization. Next I examine the impact of transnational terrorism on human rights mobilization. I use network analysis to show that, contrary to expectations of world polity theory and the boomerang hypothesis, activists' ties to the transnational rights network thinned over the same time period (1980-2000) that these states became more integrated into international society through treaty ratification and memberships in intergovernmental organizations.

This linguistic shift is of particular scholarly importance because it occurred during a time when producerist labor politics, with its emphasis on a radical reorganization of work and private property, lost significant ground to a more consumerist/economistic version of labor politics.

Existing research typically focuses on foundations' differential selection of grant recipients (i.e., ""cherry-picking"" non-threatening groups) and transformation of particular recipient organizations over time (i.e., professionalizing grassroots groups). Scholars have overlooked ways in which foundations shape social movements by building or restructuring entire organizational fields. Foundation-led ""field-building"" activities may embed social movement organizations (SMOs) in new contexts and enroll them in new projects, thus channeling protest in subtle ways. This argument is illustrated with the case of forest certification - a form of governance created in the 1990s as a moderate, market-based alternative to disruptive environmental boycotts.

Results. The results are twofold: we investigate the shift in the politics of scale of the movement, from using the same scale as the political authorities with which they interact to the creation of its own scales of action (first part); we focus on the articulation of different scales of protest, showing how, by constructing networks and coalitions, actions, and demands under the WMW umbrella, grassroots women's groups are becoming empowered and are regaining political power over the definition, dissemination, and resolution of gender issues (second part).

"Jasper, JM; Young, MP","Jasper, James M.; Young, Michael P.",The rhetoric of sociological facts,"To develop inductively a preliminary list of rhetorical tools that sociologists use in their presentation of facts, we examine three general claims that are widely accepted as having been demonstrated empirically in the field of social movements-social networks are necessary for recruitment of new members; individual mental traits do not matter; and political opportunities are necessary for movement emergence. We identify eight rhetorical tools that helped promulgate these claims as facts.

"Hipsher, PL","Hipsher, Patricia L.",Heretical social movement organizations and their framing strategies,"This article is an exploratory study of heretical social movement organizations (HSMOs) and the challenges that they face in framing their issue positions. It examines how identity communities' core issue positions serve to demarcate the boundaries of authentic group membership, making ""heretics"" out of community organizations that have contrary positions. It also analyzes how these organizations finesse their heretical status by utilizing specific framing strategies. It illustrates these processes using data on two social movement organizations involved in the American abortion controversy, Catholics for a Free Choice, a Catholic pro-choice organization, and Feminists for Life of America, a feminist pro-life organization, during the period between 1972 and 2000. I begin by demonstrating the Catholic and feminist communities' use of an abortion litmus test to maintain community boundaries. I, then, describe the two organizations' use of value amplification and boundary framing to frame their ""heretical"" issue positions both within and against their identity communities, respectively. I conclude by discussing the trend toward orthodoxy in many identity communities and the role of heretical social movement organizations in challenging this trend.",SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY,2007,77,2,,WAR,52,14,14,1,6,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0245,,,SOCIOL INQ,Sociol.

Drawing upon data from a range of sources, including the Web sites of 10 environment-oriented immigration-reduction organizations, I make the case that this movement's particular field is composed of the discursive repertoires (or messages) of a set of environmental and nonenvironmental social actors and three central discourses: science, political economy, and nationalism.

First, protesting Christians formed formal social movement organizations to better garner the resources to sustain their social movement. Second, they waged a discursive battle that challenged the legitimizing rhetoric of the state. By 1979, Christians developed a social movement industry involving the network of formal organizations as well as systematizing their rhetoric of protest in the guise of a Korean liberation theology; Minjung Theology. Drawing upon archival data and social movement theory, this study traces the rise and development of both the Christian social movement industry and Minjung Theology. We find that the emergence and evolution of mobilizing structures and movement frames were influenced by the state's repressive apparatuses and legitimizing rhetoric, respectively. Likewise, Christians' attempts to mobilize and challenge the legitimizing rhetoric of the state further contributed to the closing of the political opportunity structure.

This article examines how socially responsible (SR) mutual fund companies use core-framing tasks to shore up the ""corporate social responsibility"" collective-action frame and to create an ""SR"" identity among investors. Analyzing the Web sites of thirty-jour mutual fund companies that offer SR,funds, the author finds that there are two types of entrepreneurs. Generalists attempt building on a universal SR identity and use core-framing tasks similar to social movement innovators. Specialists, on the other hand, nurture a specific SR identity and seem more concerned with values alignment rather than diagnostic, prognostic, or motivational framing. These two innovators stand in contrast to conventionalists, traditional mutual fund companies that respond to the entrepreneurs by offering their own SR mutual funds, yet use little framing or values alignment to attract investors.",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,2007,50,,institutional entrepreneurs; collective-action frames; socially responsible investing; structural innovators and Web pages,ORGANIZATIONS; MOVEMENTS; MARKET,,16,16,0,6,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,BERKELEY,"C/O JOURNALS DIVISION, 2000 CENTER ST, STE 303, BERKELEY, CA 94704-1223 USA",0731-1214,,,SOCIOL PERSPECT,Sociol.

A cross-sectional, timeseries, negative binomial model for event counts is used to analyze the ebb and flow of Zapatista protests across the 111 municipios ( municipalities) of Chiapas during this 10-year period. The results show that while all types of demands appear to have been significant triggers of protest activity, Zapatistas concentrated their protest events in larger and more closed localities that had a history of protest activity, stable elite alignments, and a larger military presence. Openings in the political system at the local and national levels lessened protest activity in the more democratic scenarios.

Institutionalization, which is an increasingly important concept in social movement theory, provides the framework for differentiating between the two major organizing repertoires presently available to unions: the traditional National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) certification election and more recent organizing that avoids the election process. Evidence from a sample of 70 large local unions from 1990 to 2001 reveals that, although the certification election continues to be the preferred method of membership recruitment, non-NLRB organizing appears to be more effective, in terms of both victory rate and number of workers organized.

This article draws from participant-observation research to show how people also use religion to define the boundaries of group identities and relationships. Importantly, people do this in situation-specific ways that we cannot predict from people religious reasons for public actions. Evidence comes from two religiously-based organizations sponsored by the same local religious coalition, studied during 1998 to 2000 in a midsized US. city. One group is an alliance of lay people representing different churches, who organized volunteering and community development projects with a low-income minority neighborhood. The other is an alliance of clergy, representing different churches, that organized public events against racism. In each case, group members used religious terms to argue sharply over civic identity despite sharing the same religious reasons for their goals. Resolving the disputes required redefining or reemphasizing the boundaries of collective identity. The dynamics highlighted in my analyses provide new ways of understanding how people use religion to include or exclude others in civic relationships.

These public leaders founded organizations, formed networks, exercised convening power and drew on formal and informal positions of authority to achieve movement goals. Results suggest that salient religious identity and cohesive networks have played important roles in shaping the goals and ambitions of leaders within the evangelical movement. Structural coincidence provided by governance structures at evangelical organizations, as well as evangelical programs directed toward elite constituents, have facilitated the formation of overlapping networks across social sectors. Institutional inertia and internal factions, however, have been countervailing forces.

We address this question by analyzing how cooperative enterprise was affected by the Grange-a leading anticorporate movement in the United States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. State-level analyses across three industries yield three findings. First, the Grange had positive effects on cooperatives and mutuals during the nineteenth-century populist struggles over corporate capitalism. Second, these effects were stronger where corporations counter-mobilized to block challengers' political efforts. Grangers pursued economic organization as an alternative to politics and in response to blocked political access. Third, the Grange continued to foster cooperatives even as populist revolts waned. It did so, however by buffering cooperatives from problems of group heterogeneity and population change, rendering them less dependent on supportive communities and specific economic conditions. These findings advance research at the movements/organizations interface by documenting movement effects and by isolating different causal pathways through which mobilization, counter-mobilization, and political opportunity shape economic organization.

Too often, some critics argue, movements are treated as static or reified phenomena that are disconnected from their links to space and time. I examine new social movement theory from an historical perspective that emphasizes its connections with concrete social dynamics at a given point in time. Unlike alternative approaches, new social movement (NSM) theory and in particular the work of Alain Touraine, was forged out of a specific episode of social conflict-the May 1968 revolt in France-and was deeply informed by the experience of this conflict. This theory provides a dynamic and relational model in which social and historical processes are treated as major determinants of collective action within society. Infact, what explains the success of NSM theory and its enduring influence over time, is that it reaches beyond an analysis of social movements to provide an overarching theory of society at a given historical juncture.

"Oliver, PE","Oliver, Pamela E.",Repression and crime control: Why social movement scholars should pay attention to mass incarceration as a form of repression,"The disciplinary insurgency that created the academic field of social movement studies distinguished dissent from crime. This dichotomy has led the field to ignore the relation between the repression of dissent and the control of ""ordinary"" crime. There was massive repression in the wake of the Black riots of the 1960s that did not abate when the riots abated. The acceleration of the mass incarceration of African Americans in the United States after 1980 suggests the possibility that crime control and especially the drug war have had the consequence of repressing dissent among the poor. Social movement scholars have failed to recognize these trends as repression because of the theoretical turn that built too strong a conceptual wall between crime and dissent. Revisiting this dichotomy is essential for understanding repression today.",MOBILIZATION,2008,13,1,,CRIMINAL-JUSTICE SYSTEM; COLLECTIVE VIOLENCE; RACE RIOTS; POLITICAL EXPLANATIONS; AMERICAN CITIES; POLICE; INEQUALITY; PROTEST; STATES; EXPENDITURES,105,26,26,2,17,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,MAR,,285SO,WOS:000254796700001,10,2.5999999

SOCIAL FORUM IN CONTEXT","The first United States Social Forum (USSF) took place in Atlanta in the summer of 2007. To report and analyze this intense five-day event, we employ an innovative method, which we refer to as ""distributed ethnography."" This involves a large, multidisciplinary team of researchers who all contribute to our observational data and participate collaboratively in the writing and editing process. We consider how the U. S. political context shaped the character of this particular iteration of the World Social Forum. In particular, we analyze how the USSF reflected several ongoing debates within the larger World Social Forum (WSF) process: (1) whether the WSF should remain an open space or a political actor; (2) how to be more inclusive of the poorest and most marginalized social groups; (3) whether to pursue radical or reformist agenda; and (4) whether to target local, national, or global political arenas. A significant outcome of the USSF is that it challenged existing notions of open space by engaging in deliberate efforts to bring the most marginalized groups to the table. The U. S. political culture helped to mute overtly ideological debates, as many workshops and discussions instead focused on concrete projects, initiatives, and reforms. At the same time, many USSF organizers and presenters articulated a radical vision of revolutionary social change led by those who are most directly oppressed by prevailing systems of social, economic, and racial domination. Despite the many factors inhibiting radical politics in the United States, the USSF marks an important step in the process of bringing the larger struggle against global neoliberalism into U. S. politics. It also shapes the WSF process itself.",MOBILIZATION,2008,13,4,,COLLECTIVE IDENTITY; MOVEMENTS; ETHNOGRAPHY; DEMOCRACY; POLITICS; CULTURE,64,6,6,0,4,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,DEC,,393CX,WOS:000262349600003,10,.60000002

Individual factors such as age, education, income, religiosity, and organizational involvement are found to impact participation in expected directions. Results also point to a significant role for contextual factors in shaping the probability of participation. On the one hand, protest participation is more likely in cities with a greater presence of Latino organizations, which points to the importance of mobilizing agents. On the other hand, protest participation is less likely in cities with relatively large Latino populations and where more Latinos hold elected office, suggesting protest is deemed less desirable or necessary when more formal channels of political participation are viable.

This historical study begins to fill this void by analyzing the contestation between employers and labor movement actors in relation to two critical right-to-work campaigns in the industrial Midwest in the 1950s. I find that actors who balance formal, professionalized organization with a more localized presence on the ground are in a better position to pursue multiple mechanisms of influence and to shape policy, while internal divisions severely limit their prospects. Event structure analyses of right-to-work campaigns advance this discussion, revealing how social movement organizational characteristics matter to the extent that they enable opposing movements to counter each others actions in unfolding political processes.

This paper advances research in this area in three related ways. First, it links policy frames to the actors who employ them. Second, based upon this linkage it proposes two complementary approaches for examining longitudinal change in policy framing. an actor representation approach and a frame adoption approach. Third, it assesses the relative contribution Of each process using demographic decomposition analysis. This analytic framework is illustrated using the case of debates over welfare reform in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s.

Yet despite considerable scholarly interest in the ways that resources are mobilized, we know surprisingly little about the conclusion of this process, how movement actors strategically disburse resources to achieve specific goals. Recent attempts to revitalize the American labor movement, particularly efforts to reverse fifty years of membership decline, provide a substantive backdrop for examining resources and success. Data from a sample of local unions and their organizing activities from 1990 through 2001 indicate that tactical resource disbursements do increase the union's ability to recruit new members, but their effect is contingent upon other dimensions of organizing, such as firm and state hostility. The findings extend our understanding of movement agency and offer insight into the growth of social movement unionism today.

"Trumpy, AJ","Trumpy, Alexa J.",Subject to Negotiation: The Mechanisms Behind Co-Optation and Corporate Reform,"While political opportunity structure theory details how social movement organization (SMO) campaigns focus on the state and political processes, a shift toward neoliberal policies prompts those actors to target corporations directly in order to achieve their goals. This shift creates new challenges for social movements. Unlike the state, corporations are not guided by a democratic ethos, which limits movement organizations' access to decision makers. To achieve access, challenging groups often adopt institutionalized structures and tactics, which can also increase the risk of co-optation. Despite previous research, both the process of co-optation and the distinction between co-optation and other movement outcomes remain unclear. Here, applying event structure analysis to a specific case separates these outcomes: the international campaign the environmental organization Greenpeace waged to change Coca-Cola's refrigeration practices between 1998 and 2005. This analysis suggests that framing is an important strategy for SMOs to utilize, but may not be effective unless frames are backed by action. The combination of framing, institutional tactics, and noninstitutional tactics may be most effective in movement-firm interactions. Overall, this analysis contributes to a broader understanding of social movement tactics, outcomes, and framing in an age of increased corporate power.

Challenging the current research on policy change, which rarely examines the effects of global norms and local activism in one analysis, they argue (1) that global regimes empower and embolden local social movements and increase pressure on target governments from below, and (2) that local activists appeal to international forums with help from international activists to pressure the governments from above. When the pressures from the top and the bottom converge, social movements are more likely to succeed. Furthermore, these pressures are stronger in countries integrated into global society and on issues with strong global norms. The empirical analysis of social movements by resident Koreans in Japan advocating for four types of human rights - civil, political, social/economic, and cultural - demonstrates that the movements produced more successes as Japan's involvement in the international human rights regime expanded since the late 1970s, and that activism on issues with strong global norms achieved greater successes. The analysis also shows that lack of cohesive domestic activism can undercut the chances of social movements' success even with strong global norms on the issue.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2008,55,3,social movements; globalization; human rights; Korean minority; Japan,OLD-AGE POLICY; POLITICAL MEDIATION; PUBLIC-POLICY; IMPACT; WORLD; STATE; MISSISSIPPI; WAR,122,36,36,4,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7791,1533-8533,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

We identify the cultural and political evolution of the discursive legacy of ""support the troops"" from the Vietnam War through the Iraq War. Using longitudinal and comparative organizational analyses, we analyze how this discursive legacy was engaged by U. S. peace movement organizations (PMOs). PMOs frequently made positive references to U. S. troops during both the Gulf War and Iraq War, creating a stable discourse centered around supporting the troops. Moreover, during the Gulf War the movement expanded the web of support by asking who else should be cared about beyond the troops, thus de-coupling the support discourse from the nation and the state. During the Iraq War, PMOs also developed an elaborated ""discourse of betrayal"" by redefining what it means to support the troops. Here they deployed proactive, anticipatory discourses, turning the tables on the Bush administration. PMOs also increasingly criticized the troops during the Iraq War due to well publicized human rights abuses. The findings demonstrate that movement discourses are both stable and flexible, influenced by past rounds of discursive contention as well as contemporary political events.

"Beyerlein, K; Sikkink, D","Beyerlein, Kraig; Sikkink, David",Sorrow and solidarity: Why Americans volunteered for 9/11 relief efforts,"Why did some Americans volunteer to provide relief to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack victims, their families, or workers? This paper uses data from the 2002 Religion and Public Activism Survey, a nationally representative sample of adult Americans, which show that 10 percent of Americans volunteered to help victims of the terrorist attacks in some way to address this question. We argue that the act of volunteering in response to September 11 depended on levels of identification with victims of the tragedy. One of the strongest factors was personal identification with victims, which was built through personal networks such as knowing someone who was killed or in danger during the attacks, and through personal feelings of responsibility to help others in need. Identification was also constructed through involvement in social events such as community candlelight vigils that reflected on, framed, and reinforced the significance of the disaster in a communal setting. In addition, identification with victims was built through a patriotic response to the tragedy, which, we argue, motivated Americans to defend the society with which they were emotionally identified and to see victims as part of the American family to which they were obligated to help in times of need. We argue that emotions matter for disaster relief, but that sorrow rather than anger is important for generating identification with victims and thus volunteering for 9/11 relief efforts. These arguments are used to explain gender and political party differences in 9/11 volunteering. Finally, embeddedness in religious congregations promoted volunteering for 9/11 relief efforts.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2008,55,2,volunteering; civic engagement; mobilization; September 11; tragedy,HELPING-BEHAVIOR; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; SURVEY PARTICIPATION; TERRORIST ATTACKS; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; MISSING-DATA; SEPTEMBER 11; IDENTITY; COMMUNITY; EMERGENCY,114,19,19,2,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7791,1533-8533,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

In terms of results, first, the content analysis methods that are used on the interview data illustrate that SMO participants most commonly cite the social movement's formulation of a strong, social change goal when they consider the movement identification decision. Second, the logit models which are employed on the quantitative data show that engagement in externally-oriented identity work activitiesor those activities that require members to interact with nonmembers of their immediate group in building their collective identityas well as personal strain and notions of political efficacy are the most significant predictors of individual-level social movement identification.

One such instance is an episode of contention by Irish political prisoners in the late 1970s. The ""blanketmen"" appropriated and then built a solidary culture within spaces that had been under official control. Their ability to maintain such a collective response was enhanced by an intensifying cycle of protest and violent reprisal, including extreme stripping of their material environment, in which the prisoners gained considerable initiative. This study uses interviews and contemporary writings by prisoners, prison authorities, visitors, and movement activists to examine how the dynamic of protest and repression transformed insurgent prison culture-through material, emotional, and perceptive changes-and the importance of leadership in the transformation. Special attention is given to prisoner activities in appropriated spaces that reinforced the culture of resistance: promoting the Irish language, cultural production, and the production of propaganda.",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,2009,115,2,,COLLECTIVE ACTION; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; ORGANIZATIONS; REVOLUTION,91,18,18,0,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0002-9602,,,AM J SOCIOL,Am.

S. anti-GE movement had a negligible impact. In seeking to explain the different outcomes of these similar social movements, the authors draw upon the global commodity chains (GCC) literature to extend the understanding of the economic and industry-related openings and closures social movements face as they seek to promote social change. This analysis not only illustrates the importance of economic structures and organization for movement outcomes, but also shows how the economic sphere is culturally constituted. In this fashion, it broadens the social movement literature's understanding both of the way that political economy matters to movement efficacy and of the way that cultural processes infuse the economic sphere. The study advances the GCC literature by showing how GCCs are cultural as well as economic constructs.",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,2009,115,1,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES; PRIVATE REGULATION; BIOTECH MOVEMENT; WESTERN-EUROPE; GOVERNANCE; TRADE; GLOBALIZATION; CONSUMPTION; RETAILERS,137,54,54,3,31,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0002-9602,,,AM J SOCIOL,Am.

"Isaac, L","Isaac, Larry","Movements, Aesthetics, and Markets in Literary Change: Making the American Labor Problem Novel","One path to cultural innovation in artistic and literary fields is differentiation of a genre into new subgenres. But what are the dynamics at work in such a process? This article addresses that question by identifying and explaining the emergence and trajectory of a new fiction subgenre-the American labor problem novel-during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. I make a theoretical case for the intersection of social movement fields and cultural production fields showing, through a historical sociological analysis, that this subgenre was the joint product of: (1) a shift in literary aesthetic practice resulting from the rise of realism, (2) the subgenre dialogical character (3) collective contention surrounding the rise of labor movement militancy, and (4) the exigencies of literary and popular culture markets. The historical conjuncture of these processes contributed to a repository of cultural constructions of class in storied form, as novelists sought to both entertain and educate readers about the emerging realities of class-contentious industrial society.

In this article, we elaborate and appraise four core arguments in the literature on movements and their consequences: disruption, resource mobilization, political partisanship, and whether a movement benefits from an enforced policy. Our fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analyses (fsQCA) draw on new, unique data from the New York Times across the twentieth century on more than 1,200 SMOs and 34 SMO families. At the SMO family level, coverage correlates highly with common measures of the size and disruptive activity of movements, with the labor and African American civil rights movements receiving the most coverage. Addressing why some movement families experienced daily coverage, fsQCA indicates that disruption, resource mobilization, and an enforced policy are jointly sufficient; partisanship, the standard form of ""political opportunity,"" is not part of the solution.

This article seeks to develop a more inclusive theoretical and analytic framework by exploring the targets of violence, something that has received little disaggregated attention. We argue that consideration of who or what is targeted during the course of an event, together with collectivity size and the conditional role it may play, offers new theoretical insight into collective violence dynamics. Our analysis draws from newspaper records on a diverse range of collectivities, from parties to rallies to riots. We find that in many contexts, collectivity size increases the likelihood of violence against some targets, notably state actors, while reducing attacks on others. These findings provide the basis for a broader discussion of why unpacking targets is so critical to understanding the dynamics of collective violence.",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2009,74,5,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; NEWSPAPER COVERAGE; POLITICAL PROTEST; CIVIL DISORDERS; SELECTION BIAS; REPRESSION; SEVERITY; RIOTS; STATE; DEMONSTRATIONS,97,20,20,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

This article fills the void by examining the dynamics and the impact of the month-long 2004 same-sex wedding protest in San Francisco. We integrate insights of contentious politics approaches with social constructionist conceptions and identify three core features of cultural repertoires: contestation, intentionality, and collective identity. Our analyses, which draw on rich qualitative and quantitative data from interviews with participants and movement leaders and a random survey of participants, highlight these dimensions of cultural repertoires as well as the impact that the same-sex wedding protest had on subsequent activism. Same-sex weddings, as our multimethod analyses show, were an intentional episode of claim-making, with participants arriving with a history of activism in a variety of other social movements. Moreover relative to the question of impact, the initial protest sparked other forms of political action that ignited a statewide campaign for marriage equality in California. Our results offer powerful evidence that culture can be consequential not only internally, with implications for participant solidarity and identity, but for political change and further action as well.

This article examines how the anti-genetic movement in Germany during the 1980s affected six domestic pharmaceutical firms' commercialization of biotechnology We develop a process model of how movements penetrate the relatively closed polity of private organizations. External contestation weakened the position of internal champions of biotechnology, precipitated divisions among organizational elites, and undermined collective commitment to the technology The movement also increased perceptions of investment uncertainty but the consequences of this uncertainty depended on organizational logics of decision making. As a result, investments in some firms were tilted away from domestic biotechnology projects.

We maintain that both of these arguments obfuscate what is really of essence to policing of protest: the character of the protest event and the level of threat posed to police. We examine U. S. protest policing over the 1960-1990 period and show that while it is generally true that aggressive policing is less likely following the 1960s, threatening protests are always policed aggressively, regardless of the period. The findings suggest that general claims about the increasing or decreasing severity of policing over time are less useful than are arguments about the character of the protest event and the level of threat posed to police officers.",MOBILIZATION,2009,14,1,,LOCAL NEWSPAPER COVERAGE; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; DEADLY FORCE; REPRESSION; CONFLICT; DETERMINANTS; IMPRISONMENT; INEQUALITY; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION,67,43,43,0,16,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,FEB,,462SS,WOS:000267377500001,9,4.7777777

The central mechanism that has allowed punk subcultures to achieve high levels of mobilization has been the do-it-yourself ethic, which demands that punks take matters of cultural production into their own hands by making music, fanzines, and record labels, creating a network of venues for live music performance, as well as creating other forms of micromedia that are commercially independent of the corporate culture industry.

Existing investigations taking collective action framing into account typically consider only whether movement frames with broad cultural resonance are more convincing to policymakers. This study examines other qualities of movement frames to uncover argumentative forms that allow activists to persuade lawmakers to alter policy. I examine efforts by organized U.S. women in the early twentieth century to persuade state legislators to broaden jury laws to seat women jurors. Quantitative analyses reveal that jury frames that (a) define the problem of excluding women as serious and broad in scope, (b) provide a clear rationale for supporting activist demands, and (c) offer concrete evidence to support the frame's claim are likelier to convince lawmakers.

"Yamasaki, S","Yamasaki, Sakura",A BOOLEAN ANALYSIS OF MOVEMENT IMPACT ON NUCLEAR ENERGY POLICY,"The impacts of social movements on public policies have been studied extensively, yet yield mixed results. Some results point to a strong impact of social movements, while others conclude that they do not possess any observable, leverage on public policies. These mixed results may be linked to utilization of different methodological approaches. However, few studies have considered the possibility that movements may in fact prevent policy change. In this study, we argue that for high-profile policies such as nuclear energy, a low-key social mobilization is in some instances necessary for the occurrence of major policy changes. We further hypothesize that highly mobilized social movements may dampen the chance of major policy changes instead of promoting them. We briefly present the general model and the data before proceeding to the bounded exploratory analysis. This analysis raises questions about the role played by antinuclear movements in their quest for a major policy change.

Drawing on data from the US anti-death penalty movement, I find that small gains and losses significantly influence support and spending patterns. Movement success initially increases both financial contributions and programmatic spending, but over time. decreases both. Moreover the particular effect is mediated by the type of venue in which the outcome takes place: formal institutions produce different rates of increase and decline than informal ones.

Although the DOS model correctly points toward the discursive construction of political opportunities, it does not explain why certain events are experienced as opportunities by potential activists. We propose the reason is two-fold: 1) discourse contains feeling rules and 2) discourse resonance implies the shaping of protest subjectivity.

Building on studies of collective memory, the framework explicates how initial historical conditions of the nation, domestic social movements, and the degree of international pressures move the national discourse along two key dimensions-(1. acceptance of guilt and (2. international orientation of the discourse-which map out seven possible responses to collective trauma of perpetration. Through examination of the history of post-war Japan and content analyses of newspaper editorials and prime ministers' speeches from 1945 through 2004, the empirical analysis applies the framework to the Japanese case. The analysis reveals that arguments for apologies to Asian victims have gained ground due to the intensification of domestic social movements, international pressures from neighboring countries, and global human rights influence. It also shows that arguments that evade the ugly past have persisted because of the initial conditions immediately after 1945, overwhelming emphasis on Japanese victims in the ensuing decades, and recent appropriation of human rights language by proponents of the defensive arguments.",SOCIAL FORCES,2009,87,3,,COLLECTIVE MEMORY; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; UNITED-STATES; HUMAN-RIGHTS; WORLD; SOCIOLOGY; HISTORY; SOCIETY,99,17,17,4,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,,SOC FORCES,Soc.

In contrast to current understandings of identity-based movements, this article argues that the Hapa movement seeks simultaneously to deconstruct traditional notions of (mono) racial identities and to secure recognition for a multiracial ""Hapa"" identity. Movements that have identity as a goal are motivated by activists' understandings of how categories are constituted and how those categories, codes, and ways of thinking serve as axes of regulation and domination. The Hapa movement simultaneously challenges (mono) racial categories at both the institutional level through targeting the state and at the micro level through challenging the quotidian enactment of race and promulgating a Hapa identity.

We argue that status-based social movements not only enable collective identity, but also the personal identities or selves of their participants. Beliefs about the self create openings and obstacles to mutual recognition and progressive social action. Our analysis centers on the challenges that an influx of progressive, anti-racist whites posed to each movement.

Normative theories attribute the rise to female behavior changes (e. g., in response to increased freedoms or hardships). We examine whether any narrowing of the arrest gender gap is borne out across offense types of varying measurement reliability, in victimization data, and across two post-arrest criminal justice stages. Advanced time-series analyses over 1980 through 2003 support the constructionist position. First, all sources show little or no increase in women's rates for the more reliably measured offenses of homicide and robbery, and for rape. Second, the assault gender gap narrows for arrests, but holds stable in victimization data. And, third, the assault gender gap narrows moderately for convictions, but is stable for imprisonment, indicating spill-over effects of more expansive arrest policies. Several factors have produced greater female representation in ""criminal assault"" arrests including (1) proactive policing targeting and formally responding to minor violence and in private contexts, (2) interventionist developmental epistemologies that blur distinctions among violence types and circumstances, (3) the rise of social movements recognizing ""hidden"" victims, (4) law and order political messages stressing greater accountability, and (5) the somewhat greater decline in male compared to female violence in the late 1990s.

S. biodefense laboratory from being built and operated in Roxbury, Massachusetts. Cross-movement collaboration was challenged by tensions arising from differences in positionality. Positional differences reflect status distinctions such as race, class, gender, and place and the differential experiences and expectations that result. Nonetheless, this coalition was able to resolve positional tensions and, as a result, remained a viable protest vehicle. We found this was accomplished through a cross-movement bridging process that involved (1) cause affirmation, (2) strategic deployment, (3) exclusion, and (4) co-development of cross-movement commitments. We extend existent accounts of cross-movement coalition by providing both a culturally founded and fine-grained account of coalition work in the maintenance of alliance relations.

The analysis uses OLS regression with county-level data to explain variation in local support for the amendments. Results. Support for the amendments in both years was positively related to the proportion of a county that was evangelical or Republican, but negatively related to its level of education and proportion of Catholics. Amendment support was positively related in only one year to the percentage of a county's population that was professional, young, black, in female-headed households, and Mormon. Amendment support was negatively related to the concentration of gay organizations in 2006, but positively related to the presence of mega-churches in 2006. Conclusions.

Following a state-centered approach, this study argues that state-building activities are a primary origin of Islamic movements. Regimes adopt religious symbolism and functions that legitimate the role of Islam in the public sphere. State incorporation of religion thus creates Islam as a frame for political action, with increased access to mobilizing resources and better able to withstand repression and political exclusion. To provide an explicit and systematic test of cross-national variation, data on 170 political and militant organizations across the region are analyzed. Results indicate that state incorporation of religion is a crucial factor in the religiosity of movement organizations. Mixed effects of political exclusion and repression are found. No support is found for theories of economic grievances or foreign influence as causes of Islamic mobilization. In sum, analysis suggests that a state-centered perspective is the most fitting account of political Islam.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2009,24,2,Islam; Middle East; political sociology; social movements; state building; symbols,SOCIAL-MOVEMENT THEORY; IRANIAN REVOLUTION; CIVIL-SOCIETY; HUMAN-RIGHTS; TERRORISM; CULTURE; PROTEST; WORLD; POWER,53,3,3,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

"Hess, DJ","Hess, David J.",The Potentials and Limitations of Civil Society Research: Getting Undone Science Done,"The term ""undone science"" refers to absences of scientific research that social movement and other civil society organizations find when attempting to make epistemic claims in the political field. The existing literature has identified various pathways for addressing the knowledge needs of civil society organizations, including asking elected and appointed political leaders to shift funding priorities and directly seeking support and partnerships with scientists. Here, a third pathway is identified and explored: civil society organizations that have the resources to fund their own research. A sample of such ""civil society research"" from large, mainstream, U.S. environmental organizations demonstrates that although the large organizations do engage in such research, most of it is not published in peer-reviewed journals.

Using 23 in-depth interviews with women involved in the American fathers' rights movement-which has as its goal the reformation of child support and child custody laws in ways that are more favorable to men and less favorable to women-I argue that mixed-gender, antifeminist activism has the potential to produce high levels of tension for female participants between their various social identities and their collective movement identity. Indeed, almost half of these women elaborate on how two particular manifestations of their social identities-as simultaneous members of other feminist groups and simply as women-clash with the collective identity generated by the fathers' rights movement. Ultimately, these women coped with these competing allegiances in a variety of proactive ways. In contrast, the other half of the sample experienced no such tensions. These differential patterns of identity-based conflicts are suggestive of the hazards associated with a social movement's efforts to attract a wider membership base over time.",SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY,2009,79,3,,GENDER; MOVEMENTS; ACTIVISTS,50,7,7,0,1,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0038-0245,,,SOCIOL INQ,Sociol.

"Mayer, B","Mayer, Brian",Cross-Movement Coalition Formation: Bridging the Labor-Environment Divide,"Relations between the labor and environmental movements exist within a complex web of clashing interests, electoral politics, and attempts to form enduring blue-green coalitions. Unions and other labor organizations are often portrayed as solely interested in economic growth. Environmental organizations are often seen as solely interested in preserving the natural world at the expense of economic growth, thus creating a direct conflict between the interests of labor and environmental organizations. Despite these perceived differences, efforts to bridge the divide between the two movements are increasingly common. This article examines the formation of a collective identity shared by workers and environmentalists participating in the coalition. I develop this argument through an ethnographic analysis of the formation of a blue-green coalition, the Alliance for a Healthy Tomorrow, using in-depth interviews, observations, and content analyses. I demonstrate how coalition leaders and bridge brokers work to bridge and consolidate the identities of labor and environmental groups to campaign for environmental health regulatory changes in Massachusetts.",SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY,2009,79,2,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; COMMUNITY; IDENTITY,48,10,10,1,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0038-0245,,,SOCIOL INQ,Sociol.

Through an analysis of data derived from 400 structured interviews with homeless individuals in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Tucson, the authors examine why and to what extent some homeless individuals, and not others, participate in movement-sponsored protest activities. In addition, the authors assess the degree to which the factors that affect participation in this population align with previous research on participation in social movements generally. They find that certain characteristics of the homeless population reduce the importance of social ties with other homeless individuals in the recruitment process and that, contrary to what much past work would lead one to expect, homeless individuals who are less biographically available are more likely to engage in protest activity. In addition, strain, which is often not a significant predictor of engagement in other populations, is an important predictor of differential participation among the homeless. This study highlights features of the homeless population that yield somewhat different correlates of participation than found in most movement participation studies and, in turn, cautions against presuming an overall model of participation that explains the engagement of all groups in the same way.",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,2009,52,3,social movement; protest; homelessness; participation,SOCIAL-MOVEMENT PARTICIPATION; COLLECTIVE ACTION; HIDDEN POPULATIONS; FREEDOM SUMMER; NETWORKS; RECRUITMENT; ORGANIZATION; ACTIVISM; AVAILABILITY; PREDICTORS,87,10,10,1,11,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,BERKELEY,"C/O JOURNALS DIVISION, 2000 CENTER ST, STE 303, BERKELEY, CA 94704-1223 USA",0731-1214,,,SOCIOL PERSPECT,Sociol.

The author asks how and why these organizations are able to maintain this precarious position. Findings indicate that the organizations manage to balance institutional insider and outsider status in three main ways: by reinterpreting key institutional texts in ways that support their own beliefs, by claiming to represent the majority of institutional membership, and by distancing themselves from the ""corrupted"" institutional elites. Their institutional loyalty claims help create a niche in a broader social movement and attracts support from external institutional opponents. But their dual identity also puts them at particular risk of being isolated from supportive communities.

This article examines the role of the body in social movements, focusing on how social movements shape bodily postures and techniques of affective self-mastery to represent idealized citizenship. Based on archival data and the concepts of performativity and performance, I use the cases of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Citizenship Schools and Role-Playing Simulations and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's Community Centers to show how the deracialized body was materialization of liberal civic culture that sought to: (1) severe identification with the racial group in favor of identifying with an idealized national identity; and (2) change what counts as good citizenship to change who counts as good citizens. I analyze the movement's pedagogy focusing on the ritualized repetition of embodied movements that deracialized the black political body by embedding idealized citizenship into bodily postures, which increased the probability for a successful performance. Although the deracialized body was vital to the passage of the national legislation, it served to hide geographical and economic differences within the black population, producing the false correlation of national policy change with local change.",SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY,2009,50,2,,COLLECTIVE ACTION; FREEDOM SUMMER; IDENTITY; EMOTIONS; PROTEST; FRAME,61,13,13,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-0253,1533-8525,,SOCIOL QUART,Sociol.

Of particular interest to social movement scholars are findings that reveal a large disjuncture between the demands of the grassroots parents' organizations and established, elite civil rights organizations.

Because sustained collective resistance took place in Warsaw but not in the other two ghettos, a comparison of these cases is useful toward an understanding of the factors that facilitate collective action. Drawing on Schwartz's concept of ""structured ignorance"" and Snow and Benford's discussion of ""empirical credibility,"" I show that resistance occurred when and where Jews were able to gain information about the Nazi regime's genocidal plans and believed that information to be credible. The cases therefore suggest that in addition to being ""structured,"" ignorance may also be ""cultured,"" in the sense that there may be limits to what individuals will interpret as possible and true. Warsaw Jews fought back in part because they were able to overcome both structured and cultured ignorance, while Jews in the other ghettos were not able to overcome these barriers to collective action.

I argue that these frames competed in a way that challenged mobilization efforts. How do individuals work together when they may believe entirely different frameworks as explanations of the problems they seek to resolve?

Holding constant economic and political factors that typically account for changes in union density, we investigate how competition from rival labor federations and from independent unions affect both union density and a measure for the density of the dominant federation (AFL/AFL-CIO), adjusted for membership changes from mergers and splits. We measure competition by the number of unions and the size of rivals. While much existing literature measures state regulation with categorical coding for specific periods, we measure the effect of state enforcement directly with counts of pro-labor and pro-management unfair labor practice cases adjudicated by the National Labor Relations Board. We assess the effect of left-wing political culture using the popular vote for socialist and communist candidates in presidential elections. Both the number of members in rival unions and the total number of rival unions positively impact the rate of change in overall union density and in AFL density. The size of independent unions has a negative impact on AFL/AFL-CIO density but no effect on overall union density.

Among highly industrialized countries, domestic factors-resources and political institutions that afford favorable opportunities-largely explain the prevalence of environmental associations. In contrast, global forces are a powerful catalyst for environmental organizing in the developing world. The environmental movement, which had domestic origins in the West, became institutionalized in the world polity, generating new associations on a global scale.

This article examines how the myth concept has been used and develops neglected possibilities by asking: What happens when myths become incarnate, and how does this occur? In other words, what happens when conformity to a rationalized cultural ideal such as ""accountability'' is no longer symbolic but is given tangible flesh?

It highlights tensions between movement nurturance of distinct indigenous identity as intrinsically valuable and to a degree counterhegemonic and instrumental use of an environmental frame to advance indigenous land claims. This article also explores shifts in dominant discourse and institutional practices that provide both opportunities for identity-based movements as well as risks. One way identity groups address tensions between appropriation of externally generated frames for instrumental goals and the nurturing of distinct collective identities is to manage multiple frames aimed at distinct audiences with distinct content.",MOBILIZATION,2010,15,1,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; POLITICS; RIGHTS; MOBILIZATION; AMERICA; PEOPLES,47,3,3,0,7,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,MAR,,575RB,WOS:000276084100004,8,.375

Participants spent the majority of their time involved in routines. These were repetitive tasks for maintaining the organization; their focus was practical and immediate, as opposed to theoretical; and the rituals of participatory democracy structured them. At rare times, members reflected on their work, initiating abstract political talk to inspire and unify themselves in response to tedium from mundane activity or a crisis. Yet, reflection also distracted from applied work and even proliferated organizational schism.

Using expertise as leverage can be a desirable option for activists when political authorities favor technocratic decision making. Epistemic boomerang formation is possible when expert organizations encourage citizen participation in agenda setting and spaces are made for encounters between experts and activists. These processes are evident in the contentious politics of genetically engineered maize in Mexico. In this case, maize producers and community activists mobilized to confront an expert advisory group assembled by the tri-national Commission for Environmental Cooperation. As a result, the values and perspectives of many of the protesters were conveyed in the expert report and recommendations. This article examines the political outcomes of this epistemic boomerang and considers its implications for the study of social movements.",MOBILIZATION,2010,15,2,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; SCIENCE; POLITICS; CONTESTATION; MOBILIZATION; COMMUNITIES; BOUNDARIES; ECOLOGY,78,7,7,0,12,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,JUN,,613YG,WOS:000279020500004,8,.875

Movements work to create frames and collective identities that resonate with the public and bind participants together. However, movement participants are not always completely free to cultivate and adopt frames and identities. The emergence of countermovements, in particular, can fundamentally affect these tactics. However, we find that frame and identity resonance can also be influenced by other factors and conditions. We explore these issues based on participant observation and interviews with activists at two ongoing anti-Iraq war protests and one ongoing pro-invasion protest, both of which occurred over a three-month period in early 2003. We find that local context, movement-countermovement dynamics, the ability to assuage oppositional challenges, and intra-movement unity and cooperation shape overall movement trajectories and success.",MOBILIZATION,2010,15,4,,FRAMING PROCESSES; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; ABORTION DEBATE; COUNTERMOVEMENTS; IDENTITY; MOBILIZATION; ACTIVISM; OUTCOMES; CULTURE; TROOPS,74,4,4,0,9,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,DEC,,699TH,WOS:000285685200006,8,.5

The treatment of political women in the 1970s engendered the emotions that Wahl's appointment and campaign surfaced Relegating women party activists to the role of chore doers rather than decision makers humiliated them. Homemakers felt discarded and downwardly mobile after divorce. Exclusion and discrimination stung women lawyers. Feminism surfaced the powerful emotions of anger, exhilaration, solidarity, and hope that women would break down barriers. By deconstructing the rhetorical arguments of Wahl's speeches, interviewing participants in the campaigns, reading the letters that Minnesotans sent to Wahl, and examining my own emotional reactions, I uncover the emotional dimensions of these events. Understanding what catalyzed intense emotional identifications and what this historical event symbolized to participants facilitates theorizing gender as a social process and understanding why other women first to hold public office or first women candidacies generally do not become historical events.",MOBILIZATION,2010,15,2,,GENDER; CAMPAIGNS; IDENTITY; AGENDA,109,2,2,0,9,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,JUN,,613YG,WOS:000279020500002,8,.25

COMPARING PROTEST POLICING PATTERNS IN MONTREAL, TORONTO, AND VANCOUVER, 1998-2004","Scholars have argued that since the 1960s, protest policing in Western democracies has moved toward emphasizing cooperative relationships with challenging groups. This evolution is referred to as the negotiated management model of protest control. Much of the literature that informs this perspective is based on either analyses of a limited subset of demonstrations or from national-level observation. Few studies have examined whether negotiated management practices hold at city levels. This research examines city-level protest policing using 1,152 demonstrations occurring between 1998 and 2004 in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver, Canada. Bayesian logistic regression models are estimated using arrests as the response variable. The main findings suggest that only protestor premobilization and the police use of force are uniformly related to arrests; that there is considerable variation across cities; and that the larger pattern of results is not consistent with negotiated management practices.",MOBILIZATION,2010,15,4,,SOCIAL DISCIPLINARY MODEL; NEWSPAPER COVERAGE; UNITED-STATES; MEDIA COVERAGE; REPRESSION; WASHINGTON; EVENTS; BIAS,79,9,9,0,10,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,DEC,,699TH,WOS:000285685200005,8,1.125

Grotesque images can produce strong emotions that may increase the resonance of movement frames and provide physiological ""evidence"" of immorality. Such images may also produce confusion and ambiguity that deeply engages readers or viewers and potentially breaks frames. But grotesque images can also be counterproductive for activists.

Therefore, we introduce a typology of Internet activism, which shows that markedly different findings are associated with different types of Internet activism and that some types of Internet activism have been studied far more frequently than others.

While proposing a general way of operationalizing the core concepts in social movement studies, I show that political opportunity only matters during the initial phase of social movement mobilization, rather than throughout the movement's lifespan.

Social movement researchers argue that mobilization cannot proceed without pre-existing social ties, and further reflection suggests the nature of social ties is tremendously consequential. Clientelist ties are characterized by mass dependence and cooperation as beneficiaries expect favors from above. Thus, when clientelist leaders are politically excluded, a strong community-based protest is likely to take place under their leadership. However, if clientelist leaders are incorporated to share the benefits of industrial development, the result is likely to be community acquiescence even though popular grievances are endemic. This paper analyzes Taiwan's environmental politics since the late-1980s by focusing on how material compensations incorporated the previously excluded politicians.

This article elaborates on Sack's (1986) characterization of territoriality as a means to exert power by delimiting area. We analyze territoriality's role in the civil rights campaign in Northern Ireland through the late 1960s. The empirical analysis indicates that significant campaign power was rooted in the territorial boundaries and contexts that were deployed in the course of mobilization. Our intent in introducing the concept of territoriality is threefold: first, to help explain how mobilization is interwoven, through agency, with local context; second, to emphasize the utility of spatial concepts in the social movement literature; and third, to broaden the comparative range of case studies in the field of collective action by considering societies where boundaries are actively contested (weakly ""naturalized"").

By integrating field theory and organizational theory, this analysis shows that orchestra and musical director consecration and local elite cohesiveness favored innovative programming.

"Walker, ET; McCarthy, JD","Walker, Edward T.; McCarthy, John D.","Legitimacy, Strategy, and Resources in the Survival of Community-Based Organizations","Organizations active in mobilizing low- and moderate-income communities make considerable efforts to combat inequalities and build voice for citizens, despite inherent challenges of obtaining resources, maintaining member interest, and retaining staff. How, then, do such groups remain viable-even thriving-organizations? Building upon research on organizational theory and social movements, we examine patterns of survival among a sample of community-based organizations (CBOs) between 1990 and 2004, thus providing the first systematic study of their long-term mortality processes. More specifically, we test how organizations' sociopolitical legitimacy and resources (and strategies for cultivating both) influence survival, finding that the legitimacy of organizations in low- income areas is a double-edged sword, as embeddedness in resource-deprived local environments confers both benefits and disadvantages. In particular, we find the strongest support for the notion that, beyond the considerable effects of externally obtained resources, CBOs also benefit considerably by engaging in even a small amount of grassroots fundraising. Further, although we find significant effects of extra-local legitimacy in the baseline models-through organizations' affiliation with national or regional organizing networks-we find evidence in additional analyses that the survival benefits of network affiliation are largely mediated by resources. We also find sizable but marginally significant effects of local legitimacy, and significant positive effects of organizational age and urban location. Overall, our findings suggest that although cultivating resources is the surest path to survival, organizations that build their legitimacy will be in a better position to compensate for structural resource deficits.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2010,57,3,community organizing; social movements; organizations; social capital; interfaith networks,SOCIAL-MOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS; NONPROFIT; MORTALITY; REPERTOIRES; FAILURE; WOMENS; DEMISE; POOR; INSTITUTIONS; MOBILIZATION,95,39,40,5,70,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,BERKELEY,"C/O JOURNALS & DIGITAL PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2000 CENTER ST, STE 303, BERKELEY, CA 94704-1223 USA",0037-7791,,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

Ten and 20 years after their initial interviews, some respondents were still involved in Provisional Sinn Fein while others had: helped create a rival organization, Republican Sinn Fein, in 1986; helped create another rival organization, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement, in 1997; withdrawn from activism; and withdrawn from and then reentered activism. The interviews show that the decision to exit from activism was primarily motivated by changes in the respondents' personal lives and not for political reasons. For some respondents, life changes brought with them new relationships and new identities that limited their availability for activism and also forced respondents to choose between competing identities. The decision to remain an activist but to create a rival organization was influenced by interaction among subgroups of activists in Provisional Sinn Fein and by the respondents' perception of what is important for Irish Republicanism.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2010,57,3,structural identity theory; social movements; Irish Republicans; post-recruitment activism,ANALYTIC INDUCTION; LOGICAL STRUCTURE; NORTHERN-IRELAND; FREEDOM SUMMER; COMMITMENT; PARTICIPATION; STABILITY; NETWORKS; SALIENCE; HISTORY,115,12,12,0,10,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,BERKELEY,"C/O JOURNALS & DIGITAL PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2000 CENTER ST, STE 303, BERKELEY, CA 94704-1223 USA",0037-7791,,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

"Sobieraj, S","Sobieraj, Sarah","Reporting Conventions: Journalists, Activists, and the Thorny Struggle for Political Visibility","This article draws upon 134 in-depth interviews with activists and journalists in an effort to reconcile the extensive activism taking place in the shadows of presidential campaigns with its near invisibility in the news. In his classic work, Todd Gitlin (1980) demonstrated that activists become newsworthy only by submitting to the ""implicit rules of news making"" (p. 3). This research supports his finding, but demonstrates that unbeknownst to activists, coverage of political outsiders is governed by a set of rules quite different from (and often diametrically opposed to) those employed in routine news-gathering. Taking cues from news creation practices that go on daily between journalists, parajournalists, and subjects, activist groups work assiduously to prepare members to fit the needs of political reporters. They bend over backwards to be media-friendly, which they perceive as professional, quotable, and credible, but ironically these studied attempts to conform to the norms of routine political reporting make them less appealing to journalists. While journalists may attend eagerly to elected officials' press conferences and official statements, they demand authenticity, particularly in the form of emotion and spontaneity, from outsiders-the very attributes activists work to erase in their media trainings. In the end, the activist groups fail to obtain coverage, not because they can't conform to the rules of news making, but because they are following the wrong rules. This article maps the contradictory sets of norms at play in the negotiation over news, and shows how they work together to create nearly insurmountable cultural boundaries for political outsiders.

Given that nearly 60 percent of the foreign-born population in the United States is comprised of noncitizens, we argue that past studies miss an important dimension of the immigrant political incorporation process. In this article, we move beyond the ballot by documenting patterns of immigrant protest and conducting an analysis of the conditions under which immigrant organizing occurs in traditional gateways and new destinations. In addition to political opportunities and resources, we argue that conditions heightening group boundaries between immigrants and natives-what we call boundary markers-should play an important role in encouraging immigrants to develop a shared minority status and make collective claims on behalf of the larger group. Using hurdle models, we test our theoretical ideas with a new data set comprised of over 200 immigrant protest events in 52 metropolitan areas across the United States. Our results challenge past studies of immigrant mobilization because we find that inclusionary contexts characterized by greater access to formal political and economic incorporation both hinder and facilitate immigrant organizing, while boundary markers-measured here as threats and segregation-tend to encourage immigrant protest.

The findings advance a more contextualized and historically grounded understanding, demonstrating how union threat takes on greater meaning in contexts where authorities side with employers relative to labor.

We show how the organization was able to achieve success in the policy formation field but faced significantly more obstacles when trying to enter another field (policy implementation), despite its elite status. Thus, using fields to study the case can bolster scholars' understanding of elite power and status, as well as help explain outcomes.

Whether constructing large dams in the developing world or siting liquefied natural gas terminals in the United States, the onset of these projects often triggers intense popular opposition. But not always, and therein lays the animating aim of this project. We undertake a systematic comparative case analysis of mobilization efforts against 11 oil and gas pipeline projects spanning 16 countries in the developing world. Using theories from the social movement and facility siting literatures and the technique of fuzzy set/qualitative comparative analysis (fs/QCA), we examine the ""causal conditions"" linked to political and legal opposition to these projects. We find that both Western funding of projects and public consultation serve as necessary political opportunities encouraging mobilization.

Scholars have investigated the development and maintenance of collective identities as one avenue for cultural change, but to understand how activists foster change beyond their own movements, we need to look at activists' strategies for changing their targets' mindsets and actions. Sociologists need to look at activists' boundary work to understand both the wide-sweeping goals and strategies that activists enact to generate broad-based cultural changes. Using data from participant observation and interviews with animal rights activists in France and the United States, and drawing on research on ethnic boundary shifting, I show how activists used two main strategies to shift symbolic boundaries between humans and animals, as well as between companion and farm animals-(1) they blur boundaries through focusing and universalizing strategies and (2) they cross boundaries physically, discursively, and iconographically. This study contributes a new theoretical and empirical example to the cultural changes studied by scholars of social movements, and it also provides a useful counterpoint to studies of symbolic boundary construction and maintenance in the sociology of culture.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2010,25,3,animal rights; culture; ethnic boundaries; social movements; social problems; symbolic boundaries,COLLECTIVE IDENTITY; UNITED-STATES; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; GENDER; FRAME; CLASSIFICATION; PARTICIPATION; EXCLUSION; DYNAMICS; GERMANY,74,13,13,1,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

Using aggregated, cross-sectional survey data on political involvement from 34,241 respondents, we examine changes in the probability of ever having attended a protest or signed a petition over time periods and across cohorts using cross-classified, random-effects models. We find a strong generational effect on the probability of ever having attended a protest, which explains much of the observed change in self-reports of protest behavior. More than half of this generational effect is a result of compositional change, but we find little evidence that protest attendance diffused to new types of actors. We compare these findings with a less confrontational form of protesting, petition signing, which shows more period than cohort effects. We argue that social movement activities have not become a widespread means of civic engagement.",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2011,76,1,social movements; civic engagement; generational effects; protest; cross-classified; random-effects,HIGH-RISK ACTIVISM; UNITED-STATES; POLITICAL-PARTICIPATION; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; COLLECTIVE PROTEST; FREEDOM SUMMER; SOCIETY; RECRUITMENT; TIMES,59,45,45,0,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

The Differential Policing of American Activism, 1960 to 1990","How does the race of protesters affect how police respond to protest events? Drawing on the protest policing literature and on theories of race and ethnic relations, we explore the idea that police view African American protesters as especially threatening and that this threat leads to a greater probability of policing. We examine more than 15,000 protest events that took place in the United States between 1960 and 1990 and find that in many years, African American protest events are more likely than white protest events to draw police presence and that once at events, police are more likely to take action at African American protest events. Additional analyses complicate these findings by showing that they vary over time. In many years, for example, African American protest events are no more likely than white protest events to be policed.

We extend this account by including a firm's non-market rivals and suggest that firms view regulatory differences as part of a corporate political opportunity structure and exploit regulatory variations to disadvantage their rivals. Empirically, we focus on variations in right-to-work (RTW) laws that signal the pro-business climate in a state; these laws exist in 22 U.S. states. Using a spatial-regression discontinuity design, we analyze how Walmart locates new stores in the face of anti-Walmart activists and exploits regulatory discontinuities on the borders between RTW and non-RTW states. We find that Walmart is more likely to propose new stores, and to open those stores even if they are protested, at the borders of RTW states, compared with the borders of neighboring non-RTW states.

This article moves beyond such dichotomies. Content, historical, and network analyses of public debates on how to organize four lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Washington marches provide evidence for an integrative position. Rather than just describe consistencies or contradictions, we contend that the key analytic challenge is to explain the organization of differences. We propose one way of doing this using the mechanism of a cultural anchor. Within and across marches, a small collection of ideas remains fixed in the national conversation, yet in a way that allows activists to address their internal diversity and respond to unfolding historical events. These results suggest that activists do not simply organize around their similarities but, through cultural anchors, they use their commonalities to build a thinly coherent foundation that can also support their differences. Situated at the nexus of culture, social movements, sexualities, and networks, this article demonstrates how the anchoring mechanism works in the context of LGBT political organizing.",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2011,76,2,culture; coherence; social movements; sexualities; networks,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; UNITED-STATES; COLLECTIVE ACTION; FRAME ANALYSIS; NEWSPAPER DATA; GREAT-BRITAIN; IDENTITY; NETWORKS; POLITICS; TRANSFORMATION,172,28,28,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

Yet few empirical studies examine how and the extent to which civic skills transfer across distinct and separate civic contexts. Focusing on Latino immigrant members of a Los Angeles janitors' labor union, this article fills a void by investigating union members' involvement in an independent civic arena-their children's schools. Analyses of random sample survey and semi-structured interview data demonstrate that labor union experience does not simply lead to more civic engagement, as previous research might suggest. Rather, conceptual distinctions must be made between active and inactive union members and between different types of civic engagement. Results show that active union members are not particularly involved in plug-in types of involvement, which are typically defined and dictated by school personnel. Instead, active union members tend to become involved in critical forms of engagement that allow them to voice their interests and exercise leadership. Furthermore, findings suggest that the problem solving, advocacy, and organizing skills acquired through union participation do not uniformly influence members' civic engagement.

The empirical analysis compares the spread of contention on the issues of peace and civil liberties.

Drawing upon 5,398 surveys of demonstrators at antiwar protests, interviews with movement leaders, and ethnographic observation, this article argues that the antiwar movement demobilized as Democrats, who had been motivated to participate by anti-Republican sentiments, withdrew from antiwar protests when the Democratic Party achieved electoral success, if not policy success in ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The withdrawal of Democratic activists changed the character of the antiwar movement by undermining broad coalitions in the movement and encouraging the formation of smaller, more radical coalitions.

The mathematical sociology literature recommends, for example, that analyzed networks should be complete and relatively dense, that some degree of deduction should be applied to select the ""best"" model, that levels of equivalence and/or error scores should be specified, and that reliable and appropriate algorithms and levels of equivalence should be carefully selected. Some dilemmas involved in block modelling analysis are demonstrated through block modelling analysis of interorganizational networking in Friends of the Earth International (FoEI).

The problem can be addressed by analyzing opportunity/threat spirals, which involve positive feedback among: actions by challengers (bold protests and the formation of alliances between challenger groups); opportunity-increasing actions by authorities and elites (elite divisions and support, procedural reforms, substantive concessions, and police inaction); and threat-increasing actions by authorities and elites (new grievance production and excessive repression). Interactions among these eight mechanisms are demonstrated in two cases of social movement growth, the U. S. women's suffrage movement of the 1910s and the German anti-immigration movement of the early 1990s.

A negative binomial regression analysis examines the impacts of the political opportunity structure and the social movement sector on different forms of protests: single, intramovement, and intermovement protests. Statistical results show that various dimensions of the political opportunity structure render differential effects, rather than a uniform effect, on alliance patterns.

The data also suggest that these multiple engagements and overlapping activisms effectively provide linkages to and integration within social movement networks.

The findings demonstrate how the coalitions engage in framing practices not only among their members as they select and refine advocacy goals and strategies, but also by means of interaction, communication, and negotiation with a range of organized social and political actors. Through these interactions, coalition members adjust their framing of reproductive rights in response to what they perceive from other actors, taking frames from them and directing frames hack to them. These interactions occur within broader political and cultural contexts consisting of stable and variable opportunity structures.

Advocates of this perspective claim that individuals;low live in a ""movement society,"" where protest activity stands alongside more traditional forms of political participation. However, despite the theoretical advances associated with the movement society approach, comprehensive evaluations of the underlying claims are lacking. This study remedies the empirical gaps by assessing three arguments. First, are more individuals participating in protest activities? Second, are protest activities expanding to more democratic countries? Third, have protest activities become ""institutionalized,"" as indicated by a shift to nonconfrontational tactics? Analyses based on cross-national data provide mixed support for the movement society thesis. More individuals are becoming involved in protests, end this trend is observed in a large number of advanced democracies. Yet, there has not been discernable shift toward the use of nonconfrontational tactics; indeed, confrontational tactics are becoming more popular.",MOBILIZATION,2011,16,4,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; UNITED-STATES; POLITICAL-PROCESS; PROTEST; DIFFUSION; MOBILIZATION; DYNAMICS; CULTURE; MEDIA; PROFESSIONALIZATION,73,9,9,1,20,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,DEC,,868JR,WOS:000298520100005,7,1.2857143

Brokerage is defined as bridging initiatives that link actors that are separated by geographical distance, lack of trust, lack of resources, or because they are unaware of each others existence. This study is based on network data and qualitative research about networks of challengers of trade agreements in the Americas in the past two decades. Findings suggest there are different types of mediating roles and tasks that specific actors are expected to play in enduring coalitions. The experiences of Mexican and Brazilian brokers show that the roles of translators and coordinators are more easily accomplished and sustained through time than the roles of articulators and representatives.

"Sherman, DJ","Sherman, Daniel J.",CRITICAL MECHANISMS FOR CRITICAL MASSES: EXPLORING VARIATION IN OPPOSITION TO LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE SITE PROPOSALS,"Between 1986 and 1993, local activists in the U.S. organized more than 900 collective acts of public opposition to low-level radioactive waste site proposals across twenty-one counties. Yet, the number of such acts varied significantly across the counties. Both waste-siting professionals and social movement scholars have sought to identify, factors of mobilization to explain such variation. An analysis of these cases reveals that a focus limited to pre-existing factors of mobilization whether the demographic and economic factors favored by siting professionals, or the mobilization and political opportunity structures of the ""classic social movement agenda""-badly misjudges mobilization. A paired comparison of two counties that differed dramatically in the number of acts of collective opposition mustered over the course of the siting process demonstrates the importance of social mechanisms that shape just how a community interacts with its political resources. The key differences between the two counties lie in the setting, sequence, and in the combination of the following social mechanisms: social appropriation, identify shift, and the attribution of threat and opportunity. To understand the assertion of local political power in an implementation process such as siting efforts, we need to understand not only the political resources available in a community context, but also the way in which human relationships shape the perception and application of that context.",MOBILIZATION,2011,16,1,,,25,3,3,0,5,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,MAR,,740GO,WOS:000288779800006,7,.42857143

For others it is a case of social movement activism creating problems for those elites negotiating the democratization process. Among those social movements, the least studied took place in the Spanish countryside. Rural movements played a role well beyond the standard accounts in two important ways. First, they challenged significant obstacles to democratization that elite deals had left in place at the local level. And, second, the local arena had major implications for the national scene.

Supplementing existing theories, I offer qualitative evidence that development programs designed to restructure agricultural cooperatives created mobilizing structures. The reforms were intended to help family farmers adapt to the new market economy, but because most protests targeted liberalization policies, I conclude that in their short-term success, development agencies inadvertently subsidized the cost of collection action against their long-term goals.",SOCIAL FORCES,2011,90,2,,,48,2,2,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,,,SOC FORCES,Soc.

Cross-movement effects are examined to determine if founding is more or less likely to occur in counties where related civil rights and environmental organizations are located. Consistent with the notion of agglomeration effects, we hypothesize that during the 1990s the relationship among civil rights density, environmental density, and environmental justice founding is positive and suggests cooperative efforts. That is, environmental justice organizations should form in counties where civil rights organizations and environmental organizations exist. Because the focus of environmental justice organizations may have expanded over time and created a more competitive atmosphere, cross-movement relationships that were positive across counties during the 1990s are hypothesized to turn negative across counties during the 2000s. Multivariate analysis suggests mixed support for these hypotheses. Specifically, civil rights density is positively associated with environmental justice founding during the 1990s and negatively associated with environmental justice founding during the 20005 suggesting potential cooperative and then competitive effects across counties over time. However, the correlations between environmental density and environmental justice founding, while positive and statistically significant during the 1990s, are not statistically significant during the 2000s.

"King, BG","King, Brayden G.",The Tactical Disruptiveness of Social Movements: Sources of Market and Mediated Disruption in Corporate Boycotts,"This article examines factors associated with social movements' abilities to disrupt corporate targets. I identify two kinds of disruption: market disruption and mediated disruption. Market disruption deters the ability of the corporate target to effectively accrue and use market resources, while mediated disruption occurs as a tactic communicates a movement's claims about the target through third party intermediaries, like the media, thereby disrupting the target's image and reputation. Using data on corporate boycotts in the United States from 1990 to 2005, the analyses assess the extent to which movement characteristics or target characteristics cause stock price declines of boycotted companies-i.e., market disruption-and the frequency of national media attention given to boycotts-i.e., mediated disruption. The analyses indicate that target characteristics matter more in shaping a boycott's initial market disruption; however, both movement and target characteristics affect mediated disruption. Certain movement characteristics, like social movement organization (SMO) formality, public demonstrations, and celebrity endorsements, enable mediated disruption but have no effect on market disruption. A firm's size makes it vulnerable to both market and mediated disruption, while slack resources help a firm avoid market disruption. A target's reputational ranking initially buffers it from market disruption but increases its vulnerability to mediated disruption. The results indicate that the two kinds of disruption are interrelated.

Qualitative and quantitative data together generate a multifaceted understanding of emotions' interactions over time and their independent and combined ability to predict who returns to the events a year later. Previous work on emotions and movement recruitment has confined itself to whether emotional experiences were positive or negative or focused in depth on one particular emotion. This article's findings show that confusion, courage, fear, and hope have a substantial and sometimes interactive impact on attendance at subsequent events.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2011,26,1,cognition; emotion chains; emotions; framing; recruitment; religion; social movements,SOCIOLOGY,32,7,7,1,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0884-8971,,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

"Gold, SJ","Gold, Steven J.",Sebastiao Salgado and Visual Sociology,"This paper links the work of Sebastiao Salgado, recipient of the 2010 American Sociological Association (ASA) Award for Excellence in the Reporting of Social Issues, with the discipline of sociology. I reflect on Salgado's biography, method, and concerns in order to demonstrate how his work contributes to the awareness and understanding of social issues. Toward this end, I summarize sociology's record of involvement with visual documentation. Prior to 1915, the American Journal of Sociology regularly included photographs that provided visual documentation of environments under study. However, as sociology moved away from social reform activities and toward scientific investigation, the regular publication of photographs ceased. During the 1930s and 1940s, photographic projects in disciplines and social movements beyond sociology developed a variety of methods that would prove useful to sociology. During the 1970s, sociologists once again began to use visual methods in their teaching, research, and publication, putting sociology in the position to both contribute to and benefit from insights and social commitments that have distinguished Sebastiao Salgado as a globally significant photographer and social activist during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2011,26,2,documentation; photography; social activism; social issues; visual sociology,DOCUMENTARY PHOTOGRAPHY,12,6,6,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

This article examines one way collective action can be facilitated by analyzing how social movement organizations (SMOs) use narratives as a key resource for recruiting members and sustaining participation. Data for this analysis were collected through participant observation and in-depth interviews with 34 participants of the Soulforce Equality Ride (ER), a cross-country bus journey-modeled after the Freedom Ride of the Civil Rights Movement-that toured 18 schools that ban the enrollment of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students. Findings indicate that the ER recruited participants, maintained commitment to the group and its cause, and met organizational goals by (1) crafting a frame that successfully taps into potential members' existing emotions, ideologies, and experiences; (2) aligning these individual experiences with group messages and meanings via narratives; and (3) creating positive feelings for members.

In this article, the authors address this question by examining how two reproductive rights coalitions in Peru employ and manage emotions in relation to different actors who they must deal with to influence policies. Empirical materials consist of participant observation, focus groups, and individual interviews conducted with the coalitions and their members. Grounded theory was used to analyze the data. The authors distinguish relationships with five relevant actors: the internal members of the coalitions, allies, the general public, the Catholic Church as the major opponent, and government officials as the main target. As each relationship requires distinct emotion work, coalition members simultaneously adjust to contradictory emotional expectations while actively evoking and coordinating emotions.

Major studies examine how symbolic boundaries reproduce such social boundaries as race, class, and gender. In contrast, this article examines the microprocesses by which CBCO draws new symbolic boundaries over existing social boundaries within their groups. The author claims that boundary work is not just a tool for creating a new collective identity. For groups (such as CBCOs) that have entirely different ideas, norms, and practices than the vast majority of participants are familiar with, it is essential to developing a new shared ideology. Second, although boundary work is essential to acculturating members, it may have contradictory effects.

Specifically, the author observed the process of collective identity-building through ethnographic research in a mixed-race student-run organization. This case study indicates that group identity formation is a negotiated process involving strategies to achieve a sense of belonging and cohesion. The author shows that over time, by using experiences of social conflict to construct shared experiences, the members of this mixed-race organization developed collective identity.

The literature often highlights the contribution of institutionalized social movements to policymaking and sociopolitical change, but rarely addresses why and how specific social movement organizations gain routine access to formal politics. Using the Korean women's movement as a case study, I analyze the conditions for movement institutionalization. As I perceive it as the consequence both of social movements' decision to participate in government and of the state's desire to integrate such movements into its decision-making process, movement institutionalization appears when the three factors are combined: (1) pressure from international organizations, (2) democratizing political structures, and (3) cognitive shifts by movement activists toward the role of the state.",SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY,2011,52,3,,POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURES; SUFFRAGE MOVEMENTS; OUTCOMES; POLICY; DEMOCRATIZATION; ACTORS; 1990S; LABOR,87,14,15,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0038-0253,,,SOCIOL QUART,Sociol.

This study uses both primary and secondary sources to examine theatrical works linked to the Chicano movement. In particular, we are interested in the ways dimensions of collective identity such as negotiation, boundaries, and consciousness surface in narratives or texts. Theatrical scripts, we argue, give clear indications of group mobilization efforts. Through a textual analysis of plays, we also observe that Chicano theater draws on group history, language, and folklore as it defines and reinforces identity.

Conflicting Narratives of Collective Selfhood in Stigmatized Groups,"Identity politics arises out of conditions of systematic stigmatization and structural disadvantage, but sharing a social structural position does not guarantee that people will define themselves and their collectivity in the same way. In fact, because identity politics occupies two major points of tension, it gives rise to several alternative ways of conceptualizing the ""we,"" the collective self. Using ethnographic material gathered on American Jews' understandings of anti-Semitism and its relationship to contemporary politics, this article inductively discerns four alternative models of collective selfhood (embattled, relating, political, and redeemed) that correspond to four alternative narratives of identity politics (reified identity, humanistic dialogue, critical solidarity, and evangelism). These narratives help explain the deep emotions sparked by challenges to people's self-definitions.

Using a longitudinal data set of SMO protest activity between 1960 and 1995, the authors adapt novel methods for dealing with two forms of selection and measurement bias in network analysis: (i) the mechanism that renders some SMOs more likely to select into collaboration and (ii) the notion that diffusion is an artifact of homophily or indirect learning rather than influence. The authors find that collaboration is an important channel of tactical diffusion and that SMOs with broader tactical repertoires adopt more tactics via their collaboration with other SMOs, but only up to a point. Engaging in more collaboration also makes SMOs more active transmitters and adopters of new tactics.

Consequently, the community is more likely to later establish new nonprofit organizations in a different domain. Empirically, we show that Norwegian communities that were the earliest to establish mutual fire insurance organizations and mutual savings banks in the 19th century were more likely to experience foundings of cooperative stores in the 20th century.

Adopting a micro-sociological focus, we examine how emotions shape two intellectual processes central to all scientific work: conceiving creative ideas and managing skepticism. We illustrate these processes through a longitudinal study of the Resilience Alliance, a tightly networked coherent group collaborating at the center of a burgeoning scientific social movement in the environmental sciences. We show how emotions structured and were structured by the group's growth and development, and how socio-emotive processes facilitated the rapid production of highly creative science and helped overcome skepticism by outsiders. Hot spots and hot moments-that is, brief but intense periods of collaboration undertaken in remote and isolated settings-fueled the group's scientific performance and drove the SIM. Paradoxically, however, the same socio-emotive processes that ignited and sustained creative scientific research also made skepticism more likely to occur and more difficult to manage. Similarly, emotions and social bonding were essential for the group's growth and development, but increased size and diversity have the potential to erode the affective culture that generated initial successes.",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2012,77,1,collaboration; emotions; science; skepticism; social movements,SCIENCE; RESILIENCE; EMOTIONS,68,56,59,4,48,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

To remedy this, I study a novel technology of organizational adornment: theming. Case data drawn from the global casino industry reveal that theming has diffused worldwide as standard business practice. Close examination, however, reveals divergence across jurisdictions in terms of the meanings that themes convey. These patterns derive from neither successful marketing (i.e., customizing design for consumers) nor symbolic isomorphism (i.e., signaling deference to global norms). In line with the markets-as-politics paradigm, I analyze design as a field-specific conception of control. In this view, themes signal to particular constituencies that one is a certain kind of organization (and not another). The makeup of these signals and audiences-that is, what counts as socially legitimate action-will depend on the political field in which a firm is embedded.

Yet surprisingly little is known about union coalition work, from when and why it occurs to what union allies typically bring to the table. We take up these issues with a unique dataset on strike events from the 1990s and 2000s, contributing to labor and social movement research. First, we show that despite considerable academic interest in union outreach to other social movements, this phenomenon remains fairly rare. Second, our findings demonstrate how the immediate threat to unions posed by employer intransigence matters not just for the mobilization of external allies, as the social movement literature would expect, but also for the assistance brought to bear by those allies, which has received relatively little attention from scholars. Third, although we find important distinctions in unions' propensity for outreach, results suggest a more nuanced picture of union activity than previously conceived.

Yet these case studies of highly influential organizations obscure the much larger population that have little or no impact. It is therefore unclear whether civil society organizations create cultural change by deploying mainstream discourses or if they become part of the mainstream because of their success. I present an evolutionary theory of how discursive fields settle after major historical ruptures that highlights framing, social networks, and emotional energy. To illustrate this theory, I use plagiarism detection software to compare 1,084 press releases about Muslims produced by 120 civil society organizations to 50,407 newspaper articles and television transcripts produced between 2001 and 2008. Although most organizations deployed pro-Muslim discourses after the September 11th attacks, I show that anti-Muslim fringe organizations dominated the mass media via displays of fear and anger. Institutional amplification of this emotional energy, I argue, created a gravitational pull or ""fringe effect"" that realigned inter-organizational networks and altered the contours of mainstream discourse itself.",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2012,77,6,collective behavior; culture; emotions; evolution; media; social networks,LOCAL NEWSPAPER COVERAGE; WOMENS JURY MOVEMENTS; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; MULTIORGANIZATIONAL FIELDS; ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT; COLLECTIVE ACTION; SELECTION BIAS; PROTEST EVENTS; PUBLIC SPHERE; UNITED-STATES,154,56,56,2,93,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

However, there are differences between demonstrations. Some are populated with people who identify, transnationally, while others are comprised of participants who more closely identify with their national companions.

The article also reviews ECWR's activities after the mass mobilizations of the January 25th revolution. In authoritarian states, the risks inherent in challenging the regime decrease the probability that challenges will ever emerge or, if they do, continue for any significant duration. ECWR's prolonged campaign against sexual harassment, however, belies this observation. Analysis of the organization's activities provides an opportunity to examine elements that promote contentious claims making in high-risk, neopatriarchal environments. We found that the depth and strength of networks at the local level played a significant role. Also significant were ties with national and international group, which where were partly facilitated because of tourism's importance in Egypt. Through these ties, the ECWR leadership guided the organization toward increasingly promising outcomes in a unresponsive context. This case illuminates how, in the Middle East and elsewhere, civic organizations that focus on women's issues can navigate high-risk environments, whether due to neopatriarchal culture, authoritarian governance, or both.",MOBILIZATION,2012,17,4,,TRANSNATIONAL ADVOCACY NETWORKS; MOVEMENTS; OUTCOMES; STATE,50,4,4,2,35,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,DEC,,059BA,WOS:000312678200006,6,.66666669

It argues that Dar 'a 's social networks were important early in Syrian protest for several reasons: (1) They served as sites where nonconforming views on Ba'ath subordination could develop and he shared. (2) They contributed to the transfer, circulation, and interpretation of information whereby the shifting opportunities emanating from events in the region were recognized and the regime's threats were framed in ways that compelled people to act. (3) They provided an important sense of solidarity and presented the background against which recruitment for mobilization took place.

Since the ""Arab Spring"" emerged in the winter of 2011, however, observers have rushed to explain mass revolts in the region. This introduction to the special issue reviews some of the explanations offered for these extraordinary events, and finds that the factors that are frequently cited in these explanations do not map comfortably onto the sites of greatest protest in the region. The essay then suggests an alternative approach, one that looks past causation in an attempt to understand the lived experience of the uprisings. The goal is to examine how actors changed as they perceived the possibility of protest, how they made meaning of their lives through the act of protesting, or not protesting, during moments of exceptional confusion and stress. This approach focuses on the twists of history that confound social scientific explanation. One twist that is highlighted in this essay and throughout the special issue is the sudden prominence of bravery-the ineffable but potentially influential desire to engage in risky protest. Bravery is not a causal variable but a disposition that may appear and disappear with the vagaries of the moment, altering the micro-flow of events and making a noticeable, if tiny, difference in the course of mass protests.",MOBILIZATION,2012,17,4,,REVOLUTION,51,9,9,0,54,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,DEC,,059BA,WOS:000312678200001,6,1.5

After mapping out the protest wave, I make three main arguments. First, pre-electoral campaigns created spaces for interaction rituals of ""brokered exuberance"" among participants in public rallies that lowered perceptions of risk and spilled over into contentious protest after the election. Second, ordinary, non-networked Iranians utilized face-to-face interaction to broaden and recharge the protest wave, while Internet activism confused as much as coordinated the organization of street protests. Third, the social power and political orientation of Green protestors were connected to the increased relative size of the middle class in Iran, which had been empowered and enlarged through the state's developmental efforts over the past two decades.",MOBILIZATION,2012,17,4,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; EMOTIONS; MECHANISMS,66,2,3,2,37,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,DEC,,059BA,WOS:000312678200005,6,.5

Employing data from protest surveys of demonstrations that took place in seven European countries (2009-2010), we test whether these types of protesters are differentiated by biographical-structural availability and/or psychological-attitudinal engagement. Our results suggest that biographical availability distinguishes our four groups, but not as a matter of degree. Few indicators of structural availability distinguish between the groups of protesters, and emotional factors do not distinguish between them at all.

We build on the relational tradition in the study of social movements and contentious politics by expanding on a mechanism-process research strategy. Attentive to similarities as well as to dissimilarities, our comparative framework traces processes of radicalization by delineating four key arenas of interaction-between movement and political environment, among movement actors, between movement activists and state security forces, and between the movement and a countermovement. Then, we analyze how four similar corresponding general mechanisms-opportunity/threat spirals, competition for power, outbidding, and object shift-combine differently to drive the process. Last, we identify a set of submechanisms for each general mechanism. The explanatory utility of our framework is demonstrated through the analysis of three ethnonational episodes of radicalization: the enosis-EOKA movement in Cyprus (1950-1959), the Provisional Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland (1969-1972), and the Fatah-Tanzim in Palestine (1995-2001).",MOBILIZATION,2012,17,1,,US WOMENS SUFFRAGE; TERRORISM; PERSPECTIVE; MOVEMENTS; VIOLENCE,66,30,30,3,38,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,MAR,,924CM,WOS:000302668400002,6,5

One potential line of investigation would be to more systematically explore the socializing effects of political events. Indeed, vivid political events should be important catalysts because they can have significant effects. Events may have an impact at any age but socializing effects will differ based on one's position in the life cycle, from conversion for younger participants to substantiation for older participants.

We find that as armed activists face the challenges of arrest and detention, trial, and imprisonment, the network of trial support groups and defense committees that was central to their capacity to engage in violence at the peak of the protest cycle also facilitates the process of disengaging from violence as the cycle declines. The distinctive characteristics of this network (herein referred to as the legal support network or LSN) permit insurgents to retain a movement identity while disengaging from violent activity.

Successful mobilization against witch-hunts are possible when two conditions are met: first, when activists are able to tap into microcredit groups' social capacity for collective mobilization (defined by ties of mutual dependence, reciprocity, and friendship): and second, when activists are able to use strategic framing to present a coherent argument about the congruence of microcredit and anti-witch-hunt goals. In this context a master frame (women's development) emerged that effectively forged the seemingly disparate goals of microcredit loans and anti-witch-hunt campaigns into one synthetic movement. In contrast, successful mobilization against witch-hunts was difficult in areas where the activists did not have access to the microcredit networks or were not able to strategically frame the campaign.",MOBILIZATION,2012,17,2,,COLLECTIVE ACTION; PHENOMENOLOGY; MOBILIZATION; CREDIT,55,7,7,0,10,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,JUN,,964SA,WOS:000305715800004,6,1.1666666

We examine the events leading up to this call that illustrate how threat is intertwined with the adoption of leaderless resistance. Using a combination of interview and questionnaire data collected primarily from white power movement followers, we examine views on leaderless resistance as well as the use of violence to advance movement goals. Our findings suggest that while there is support for leaderless resistance, most respondents believe that this strategy should be used in conjunction with leader-led organizations. While most of our respondents supported the use of violence, holding this view does not explain a strategy preference (leader-led organizations or leaderless resistance). Respondents who feared infiltration were more likely to support leaderless resistance. Although not significant, those favoring an electoral-politics strategy were more likely to prefer leader-led organizations over leaderless resistance.",MOBILIZATION,2012,17,1,,IRANIAN REVOLUTION; TERRORISM,44,8,8,0,6,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,MAR,,924CM,WOS:000302668400004,6,1.3333334

Yet social movements, even those that are ultimately defeated, may have an enduring impact on the communities in which they were once active. This impact may be far removed from the movement's stated goals and may be detrimental to constituents and to society at large. We identify an empirical relationship between Ku Klux Klan activism in the 1960s and increased numbers of homicides in southern U.S. counties in subsequent decades.

"Wada, T","Wada, Takeshi",Modularity and Transferability of Repertoires of Contention,"A ""modular repertoire of contention"" denotes prevalent forms of interaction that are used by a variety of actors against a variety of targets for a variety of issues in a variety of locations. Modular repertoires are important in the literature of contentious politics and social movements because of their transferability across different contentious contexts. This study addresses three limitations in the literature. First, discussion about modular repertoires to date has been framed as if some forms of contention were modular and other forms were not-thus a dichotomy is set up between modular and nonmodular forms. Second, specific dimensions of modularity (transferability across actors, targets, issues, and locations) have been mostly ignored in the literature. Third, an empirical measure has not yet been developed for the concept. By assessing how broadly a form of contention is diffused across actors, targets, issues, and locations, this study develops a new measure of modularity. Using the measure, it evaluates Charles Tilly's modular repertoire hypothesis. According to the hypothesis, public meetings, petitions, and demonstrations became a modular repertoire in Great Britain during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as a result of Parliament's rise as the center of British national politics. The results obtained here offer new insights. The empirical measure proposed will advance our understanding of repertoires of contention and political systems.

"Jaffee, D","Jaffee, Daniel",Weak Coffee: Certification and Co-Optation in the Fair Trade Movement,"The sociological literature on social movement organizations (SMOs) has come to recognize that under neoliberal globalization many SMOs have moved from an emphasis on the state as the locus of change toward a focus on corporations as targets. This shift has led some SMOs to turn to forms of market-based private regulatory action. The use of one such tactic-voluntary, third-party product certification-has grown substantially, as SMOs seek ways to hold stateless firms accountable. This article explores the case of the international fair trade movement, which aims to change the inequitable terms of global trade in commodities for small farmers, artisans, and waged laborers. Drawing from interviews with a range of fair trade participants, document analysis, and media coverage, the article describes fair trade's growing relationship with multinational coffee firms, particularly Starbucks and Nestle. It explores intra-movement conflicts over the terms for and the effects of corporate participation in fair trade, and illuminates tensions between conceptualizations of fair trade as movement, market, and system: The article makes two arguments. First, while fair trade has succeeded partially in reembedding market exchange within systems of social and moral relations, it has also proved susceptible to the power of corporate actors to disembed the alternative through a process of movement co-optation. Second, it argues that co-optation takes a unique form in the context of social movements whose principal tools to achieve social change are certification and labeling: it occurs primarily on the terrain of standards, in the form of weakening or dilution.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2012,59,1,social movements; co-optation; certification; fair trade; coffee,ANTI-BIOTECH MOVEMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; FOREST CERTIFICATION; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; MARKET; GLOBALIZATION; LABOR; STANDARDS; QUALITY; JUSTICE,95,41,43,4,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7791,1533-8533,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

In this study, 1 explore an important and understudied form of frame variation, whether activists use more moderate or more radical frames. Using framing data from the early twentieth-century U.S. women's jury movements, I first show that activists offered both a more traditional and moderate difference frame, arguing that women should be permitted on juries because they would provide a unique female perspective in jury deliberations, and a more radical equality frame, stating that women had an equal right to sit on juries and they were as intellectually capable as men to do so. Second, I demonstrate that a combination of circumstances explains whether the jury activists were likely to articulate more moderate or more radical arguments. I find that frame variation is driven by activist organizational identities, a cultural and political resonance process, and a counterframing process. Findings from multinomial and binary logistic regression analyses reveal that all three processes influenced jury activist framing.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2012,59,1,social movements; women rights; legal rights; framing; juries,COLLECTIVE ACTION FRAMES; ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT; SUFFRAGE MOVEMENTS; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; ABORTION DEBATE; PEACE MOVEMENT; UNITED-STATES; ORGANIZATIONS; RESOURCES; DYNAMICS,114,21,21,2,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7791,1533-8533,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

Recently, sociological scholarship on organizations has converged with research on the professions to discuss the ways in which professions are shaped or influenced by different organizational forms. In this article, I borrows from the notion of framing within social movement research to argue that organizational forms frame the bids of aspiring professionals. More specifically, I argue that certain organizational forms-such as that of the modern corporation-can aid would-be professionals in making their claims for professional recognition. Organizations do this, I argue, by providing aspiring professionals with a ready-made setting, rationale, and guarantees that make the newcomers more easily recognizable as professionals to outside audiences. I explore this argument by examining how the corporate form has facilitated private military contractors in their attempts to legitimate and develop this highly controversial new industry. The data are drawn from my interviews with private military contractors, state officials, and other interested parties surrounding private military corporations, as well as from archival data that detail the rise of the private military industry.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2012,59,3,organizations; professions; frames; private military corporations; mercenaries,,66,3,3,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7791,1533-8533,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

Like artists and politicians, social movements develop a ""reputation"" that includes a capsule history of a movement's origins, goals, and impact. Both popular narratives and scholarly treatments identify four books published in the early 19605 as having spurred important social movements and government action. This ""big book myth"" provides a simple origins story for social movements, a version of an ""immaculate conception"" notion of social change. We compare the mythic accounts of feminist, environmental, anti-poverty, and consumer movements of the 1960s to fuller histories of these movements and find consistent distortions in the common big book narratives. Mythic accounts shorten the incubation time of social movements and omit the initiating efforts of government and political organizations. The myths develop and persist because they allow interested actors to package and contain a movement's origins, explicitly suggesting that broad social dynamics replicate idealized individual conversion stories. They also allow actors to edit out complicated histories that could compromise the legitimacy of a movement or a set of policy reforms. These mythic accounts spread and persist because they simplify complicated social processes and offer analogues to the individual process of becoming active, but they may lead us to misunderstand the past and make misjudgments about collective action and social change in the future.

I bring boundary construction theory into conversation with counterframing analysis to expand understanding of how framing and counterframing strategies revolve around the competition for common, moral resources. I explain that in the movement to close the School of the Americas, protesters claims have served as moral boundaries against which the targeted institution has redefined its objectives and programs.

We examine a 100-year time series of EMO founding, showing that, in addition to the legitimation-and-competition effects of organizational density, EMO founding is facilitated by the discourse-creative activities of critical communities, objective threats in terms of air pollution, foundation giving, and powerful political allies in the presidency and Congress.

A case study of a new cultural narrative, dubbed ""virgin chic,"" shows the imprints of the American Right. Through analysis of the mobilizing efforts of right-wing think tanks, this article shows that the Right's development of the ""family values"" frame and its sponsorship of federal bills aimed at legislating morality resulted in ""virgin chic.""

First, we treat religious organizations as multi-unit entities operating in interdependent markets in a national field. Second, we incorporate insights from social movement theory to challenge the exclusive focus on the impetus to mobilize (competition) by also considering the capacity to do so (resources). Third, we consider competition within organizations as well as between them. To analyze mobilization directly, we study a key religious resource, magazines. We analyze original data covering virtually all faiths and affiliated magazines in antebellum America, a time of great religious ferment. Consistent with our conception of religious organizations, we find that competition played out mostly within a national field. Consistent with resource mobilization theory, we find that the geography of religious mobilization reflected variations in the availability of resources more than variations in the intensity of competitive pressures. Conceiving of religious organizations as translocal movement organizations rather than local firms better accounts for their behavior.

Why are some leaders more committed than others? We draw from scholarship on civic participation, volunteering, social movements, and team management to develop an original explanation. Although theory suggests individual and organizational factors may explain differences, most prior empirical studies examine only individual-level hypotheses. We use data collected from 1,616 Sierra Club volunteer leaders and the 368 chapters and groups they led to conduct multilevel analyses of the determinants of behavioral commitment among leaders. At the individual level, we find that leaders with more applicable skills, available time, and aligned motivations are more committed to the organization. At the organizational level, we find that leaders whose organizations are more complex, and who are on teams that operate more interdependently, share work more equally, and devote smaller shares of time to meetings, are more committed.

This article uses a comparative analysis of welfare reforms in California and Arizona to examine how anti-Hispanic stereotypes affect social policy formation. Drawing on interviews, archival materials, and newspaper content analysis, I find that animus toward Hispanics is mobilized through two collective action frames: a legality frame and a racial frame. The legality frame lauds the contributions of documented noncitizens while demonizing illegal immigrants. The racial frame celebrates the moral worth of White citizens and uses explicit racial language to deride Hispanics as undeserving. These subtle differences in racialization and worth attribution create divergent political opportunities for welfare policy. When advocates employ the legality frame, they create openings for rights claims by documented noncitizens. Use of the racial frame, however, dampens cross-racial mobilization and effective claims-making for expansive welfare policies. These findings help to explain why the relationship between race and welfare policy is less predictable for Hispanics than for Blacks. They also reveal surprising ways in which race and immigration affect contemporary politics and political mobilization.",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2013,78,2,welfare state; immigration; race; politics; social movements,WELFARE-STATE; AMERICAN; POLITICS; MOVEMENT; REFORM; CITIES; RELIEF; COLOR; LAW,112,29,29,2,46,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

We also consider a gendered development model and the role of welfare states as main explanatory variables in accounting for the gap in earnings. Our findings suggest that even in the presence of these alternative explanations, women's activism matters. Furthermore, women's organizations with access to institutional politics, through either direct advocacy or ties to unions or professional associations, have had the most success in promoting gender earnings equality.

The dominant approach in social movement studies stresses the role of political opportunities and threats in facilitating or undermining alliances between oppositional groups. This article argues, by contrast, that the convergence and divergence of contenders' perceptions mediate between political opportunities and shifting alliances. Whereas previous studies conceptualize perceptions as global assessments of actors' environments, I disaggregate three dimensions of the concept: optimism about state elites, optimism about state institutions, and optimism about contentious collective action. The Iranian Reform Movement of 1997 to 2005 offers a nearly ideal case for the study of perceptions and alliances, because it encompasses a variety of opposition groups whose alliances formed and disintegrated over the course of the movement's rise and decline.

I argue that a key factor was the revolutionary vanguard's emergence through taking over existing activist organizations. Using reports and meeting minutes of 28 organizations and individual activists' correspondence, diaries, and memoirs as sources for comparative cross-sectional analysis and processual case studies of the organizational debates over whether to adopt Bolshevism as a unifying ism, I find that a crucial factor explaining an organization's positive response to Communist bloc recruitment was whether it practiced ethical activism, which engendered a sectarian group ethos that meshed with Bolshevik organizational culture. By contrast, the absence of ethical activism, and the correlative mismatch in organizational ethos, was associated with a negative response to Communist recruitment efforts. Two key mechanismsframe resonance and group disciplinemediate this selective attraction. I conclude by discussing how organization-level analysis of selective spillover between social movements enhances our understanding of both individual participants' motivations and the distinct style in which a movement responds to its political environment.",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2013,78,5,vanguard party; ethical activism; group ethos; movement spillover; mobilization; Communism,SOCIAL-MOVEMENT; SOLIDARITY; CULTURE; PROTEST,87,4,4,1,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

Focusing on the first decade of the twentieth centuryin many respects for labor, a period not unlike the presentI seek to explain the pattern of organizing success and failure across industries and occupations. I find that the most organized settings occurred where workers had greater disruptive capacities due to the high cost of being replaced during work stoppages. The highest replacement costs were associated with three conditions: scarcity of skilled labor, geographically isolated worksites that raised the cost of importing strikebreakers, and time-sensitive tasks that rendered replacement workers economically impractical. Workplaces that had at least one of these conditions formed the backbone of the early U.S. labor movement.

Scholars have identified a number of factors that inspire the development of commitment, including consciousness raising, empowerment, social ties and the development of a shared collective identity. In this article, we highlight another factor that the movement literature has thus far neglected: skills acquisition. Using data from interviews with participants in the AFL-CIO's Union Summer student internship program, we elaborate on the processes through which participation generates a feeling of empowerment, specifically showing that participants in an intensive movement campaign can learn concrete organizing skills which empower and inspire them to sustain their involvement in activism. In addition, we find that social ties are important not only because of the information and support they provide, but also because they transmit human capital. We demonstrate that those who come to an activist campaign with less experience, and those who participate in a better-organized campaign are more likely to gain activist human capital through their participation.",MOBILIZATION,2013,18,2,,RESOURCE MOBILIZATION; STUDENT PROTEST; LABOR-MOVEMENT; PARTICIPATION; NETWORKS; REVITALIZATION; ORGANIZATIONS; RECRUITMENT; DYNAMICS; IDENTITY,64,10,10,2,22,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,JUN,,227ZD,WOS:000325153300005,5,2

The crucial implication, I argue, is that instances of a tactic belong to one or a few lineages, each radiating from a single invention and comprising a series of adoptions and repetitions. This implication is tested by examining suicide protest: killing oneself, without harming others, for a collective cause. The decline in cruel public punishment and the growth of news media increased the potential utility of this tactic. There were multiple inventions of suicide protest, but only in Japan was there a recognizable lineage in the early twentieth century. The sacrifice of a Vietnamese monk in 1963 created a model, which was adopted in many different countries for varied collective causes.

However, the interplay between collective identity and the subjective nature of opportunities has been largely unexplored. We address this gap in the literature by delineating how conflicting perceptions of salient political opportunities can fuel animosity and threaten movement identity. We draw from a unique qualitative dataset on the Czech environmental movement collected over a ten-year span. In 2002, a group of movement leaders circulated a manifesto urging environmentalists to stage a coup d'etat of the Czech Green Party. Controversy erupted as some activists felt that the rallying call violated their longstanding independence from party politics.

Regarding information from management, trust is the most important determinant for preventing workers from participation.

Results show that few demonstrations pass the television gates (11%). Above all, protest size accounts for newsworthiness. Disruptive and symbolic actions also attract the media spotlight, confirming drama and visuals as critical television news values. Whereas symbolism matters for media presence, it does not hold for headline (prominence) or length of coverage (volume). New social movements are especially likely to stage symbolic actions.

Based on the pattern of protests following a similar economic crisis, one would expect protests by organized labor against the government.

I argue that the Turkish shopkeepers' ground-level understandings of economic processes-their moral economy-were at the origins of these protests. Furthermore, I demonstrate that organized labor's failure to mobilize resulted from the decline of associational capacity and strength of trade unions.

Drawing on an analysis of two organizations mobilizing around academic freedom, Students for Academic Freedom (SAF) and Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), we find that an organization's reputation is consequential. FIRE, which has a strong reputation, gets high-quality coverage and primarily uses this media attention to threaten its targets. SAF has a weak reputation and, consequently, uses alternative and organizational media to create opportunities to spread its ideas to a broader public. It does so by exploiting the linkages among media outlets and moving its ideas from smaller to larger news outlets.

We propose that frames can be analyzed in terms of three fundamental components: collective identity (the subject), the collective action of the subject (the verb), and who or what the target of those actions is (the object). We use this structure to approximate primary frameworks of contention for two key players in the Palestinian national movement, and then trace changes in the subject-verb-object grammar as part of the keying process by which the movement, overall, increasingly embraced radical Islam.

This study offers a new perspective on consequences by taking a socio-legal approach that considers how law is constructed and enacted in professional fields and how legal and professional logics intersect to influence professional decision making. Drawing on ethnographic interviews, surveys, and content analysis about the Emergency Contraceptive Pill (ECP) conflict in pharmacy, I find that professional logics largely supersede legal ones to influence decision making and that organizational positioning and perceived policy affect collective goods distribution. These forces diminish the power of pro-choice and anti-abortion laws as professionals interpret, construct, and ignore the law in daily practice. The concluding discussion emphasizes the importance of considering professionals as targets of social movement action, reconceptualizing collective goods and implementation, and using field theory as methodology.",MOBILIZATION,2013,18,4,,PRO BONO; LAW; ORGANIZATIONS; POLITICS; INSTITUTIONS; CULTURE; MEDIA; STATE,58,2,2,2,14,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,DEC,,274VM,WOS:000328634300005,5,.40000001

I trace the motivational origins of the boycott in worsening social interactions that caused a sense of abuse and humiliation in black passengers due to three main factors: changing ratios of black and white passengers on the public buses; labor-related issues that frustrated the bus drivers; and the impact of the 1954 Brown decision on the bus drivers. This study calls for a framework that conceptualizes and connects lived experiences and real contentious social interactions with the emergence of protest motivations and social movements.

This essay takes up and refines the concept of intellectual opportunity structure to describe factors that enable or constrain movement efficacy in these efforts. Based on interviews with key claimants, participant observation at conferences, and content analysis of media, scientific, and activist literature, this article explains how the ex-gay movement in the United States mobilized knowledge and protest to shape mainstream science. Since 1973, gay-affirmative policies in mainstream mental health institutions have increasingly blocked construction of scientific facts based on the pathologization of homosexuality. Yet, the ex-gay movement has more recently found limited success blending theological premises and science-based methodologies. Shifts in intellectual opportunities, including formal acknowledgement of religious diversity by psychologists, have led the American Psychological Association (APA) to incorporate some ex-gay movement ideas even as the APA maintains that sexual orientation, newly defined, cannot be therapeutically altered.",MOBILIZATION,2013,18,1,,CONVERSION THERAPY; AVERSION THERAPY; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; POLITICS; CLIENTS; HOMOSEXUALITY; CAMPAIGN; EFFICACY,94,5,5,0,12,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,FEB,,147VO,WOS:000319196600001,5,1

Two arenas of contention, movement-countermovement interactions and the structure of political opportunities and threats, are examined to understand the outbreak of the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland. The evolution of radical contention is explored through Quantitative Narrative Analysis (QNA), an innovative method that systematically records social actors and their interactions within an event. Relying on computer-assisted story grammars [the Subject (S) - Action (A) - Object (O) sequence and their modifiers] to parse narrative data, 6,035 semantic triplets were stored in a relational database. Sequential network models are used to analyze the database and reconstruct the nature and evolution of the interactions among the main political actors involved in the Troubles. Four distinct phases of the conflict are unveiled through network models of violence, indicating how and when the conflict radicalized, and how actors shifted their strategies of contention. Archival data are used to specify how mechanisms of radicalization, such as hostile counter-mobilization, repression, object shift and boundary activation, engendered the conflict.",MOBILIZATION,2013,18,4,,CIVIL-RIGHTS-MOVEMENT; IRISH-REPUBLICAN-ARMY; POLITICAL VIOLENCE; SELECTION BIAS; PROTEST; REPRESSION; DYNAMICS; MOBILIZATION; TERRORISM; EMERGENCE,88,7,7,1,17,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,DEC,,274VM,WOS:000328634300007,5,1.4

"Fine, GA","Fine, Gary Alan",Apology and Redress: Escaping the Dustbin of History in the Postsegregationist South,"How at moments of dramatic change and a shifting social context do political actors alter their public identities? Put differently, how do political figures respond when positions with which they have been closely identified are no longer morally and electorally defensible and must be altered? Responses to identity challenge within institutional spheres require an expansion of the theory of accounts to an approach that examines shifts in cultural fields. Those challenged must signal adherence to newly claimed values. The standard view of accounts examines interpersonal justifications outside of institutional pressures, downplaying social location. Extending a theory of accounts to political actors requires recognizing appeals to audiences and distribution of resources. In the political arena the presentation of accounts carries reputational dangers. Presenting excuses, politicians deny agency, placing themselves at jeopardy as incompetent. Justifications require a credulous audience that overlooks possible insincerity. As a result, other strategies are necessary. Political actors rely on apologies or redress to demonstrate a revised self to stakeholders, strategies based on position, resources and audience. To analyze the realignment of reputation in unsettled times, I examine the postsegregation careers of Governor George Wallace of Alabama and Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. Both moved from being icons of segregation to (claimed) devotees of racial equality, but because of their political location they moved in different ways. Given their context, Wallace apologized, while Thurmond provided redress to offended communities.",SOCIAL FORCES,2013,91,4,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; ACCOUNTS; MEMORY; VOCABULARIES; GENERATIONS; SYMBOLS; TRENDS; RACE,92,0,0,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,,,SOC FORCES,Soc.

Immigration scholars have begun exploring similar distinctions among immigrant groups, with most research highlighting the role of anti-immigrant forces, the media, and policymakers in constructing divisions. Ethnographic research on the New Sanctuary Movement, a network of interfaith immigrant rights organizations, reveals that pro-immigrant activists also construct distinctions between ""deserving"" and ""undeserving"" immigrants. Building on frame alignment theory, which often focuses on movement discourse, I use a dramaturgical approach to highlight the nonrhetorical framing practices involved in creating these distinctions: in particular, the casting of select members of stigmatized groups and their public and visual association with more powerful actors. Through a type of frame transformation I call the model movement strategy-the use of model cases to challenge negative stereotypes of members of disadvantaged groups-New Sanctuaty activists drew distinctions between model immigrants and those who did not share their dominant-friendly characteristics, implicitly portraying certain undocumented immigrants as less deserving of legal residency and citizenship.

Based on ethnographic fieldwork, this article examines the dynamics of demobilization of popular movements in a context of patronage politics. I argue that demobilization in these contexts results from relational processes creating a dual pressure stemming from below and from above. In social environments where patronage is pervasive, poor people develop survival strategies relying on clientelistic arrangements. They participate in a social movement organization (SMO) to voice their rights, but also to address pressing survival needs by gaining access to resources. These expectations of constituents create a pressure from below on leaders of an SMO, which respond by securing resources obtained through alliances with national political actors. In turn, these alliances create a pressure from above, because local leaders reciprocate this national support by eschewing the organization of collective actions. Drawing on data culled from 12 months of fieldwork on an Argentine peasant movement, this article inspects the interconnections between popular movements and patronage politics to refine our understanding of demobilization processes; contribute to discussions regarding the role of culture on contentious politics; and shed light on current demobilization trends in Latin America.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2013,28,4,Argentina; culture; demobilization; patronage politics; political ethnography; social movements,COLLECTIVE ACTION; UNITED-STATES; ARGENTINA; CLIENTELISM; COOPTATION; CONTENTION; CULTURE; ORGANIZATIONS; ETHNOGRAPHY; MECHANISMS,97,5,5,3,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

At the individual level, it is found that men, younger people, and individuals with more education and income show a higher level of support. At the country level, national affluence, political change (de-democratization), and linkage to the world society are associated with more support. I further integrate individual-level characteristics and country-level social contexts, and pay special attention to education.

"Mayrl, D","Mayrl, Damon","Fields, Logics, and Social Movements: Prison Abolition and the Social Justice Field","This essay argues that field analyses of social movements can be improved by incorporating more insights from Pierre Bourdieu. In particular, Bourdieu's concepts of logic, symbolic capital, illusio, and doxa can enrich social movement scholarship by enabling scholars to identify new objects of study, connect organizational- and individual-level effects, and shed new light on a variety of familiar features of social movements. I demonstrate this claim by delineating the contours of one such field, the social justice field (SJF).

Issue selection is an important area of study given that advocacy organizations have limited time and resources and thus many potentially important issues go ignored. Yet issue selection remains an understudied question in the scholarly study of advocacy organizations. In this article, the author draws on historical data, interviews, and a database of statements by major human rights advocacy organizations to examine one particular historical puzzle regarding issue selection: why advocacy organizations have focused on the recent conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan rather than the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, even though more people have died in the Congo. The author finds that advocacy organizations select issues not based on their severity but based on framing, political opportunities, and organizational resources.",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,2013,56,2,advocacy organizations; social movements; political sociology; human rights; genocide; issue selection; Darfur; Congo,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; POLICY; POLITICS,72,3,3,3,7,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,BERKELEY,"C/O JOURNALS & DIGITAL PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2000 CENTER ST, STE 303, BERKELEY, CA 94704-1223 USA",0731-1214,,,SOCIOL PERSPECT,Sociol.

CULTURAL CATEGORIES OF WORTH AND SCHOOL FINANCE REFORM,"From the standpoint of the existing literature on cultural categories of worthiness or deservingness, school funding equalization presents a paradox: why has a reform targeted at morally deserving children been so difficult to enact? This article investigates cultural constructions of worthiness, which have been shown to affect the debate and implementation of social welfare policies, in this new policy arena. The authors analyze newspaper coverage in California and Texas, over multiple time periods, to explore whether and how arguments about deservingness of the policy's beneficiaries appear in debates surrounding school finance reform. The authors find that even though children are widely accepted to be morally worthy, the deservingness of other groups complicates the debate. The deservingness of taxpayers, teachers and administrators, and parents is contested, and can challenge or dilute claims about the deservingness of children. These findings help make sense of the paradoxes of school finance reform by showing how deservingness can still be contested even though the target population is widely accepted to be morally worthy.",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,2013,56,4,education; education policy; culture,PUBLIC-POLICY; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; WELFARE-STATE; EDUCATION; IDEAS; POLITICS; OPINION; POVERTY; COMMUNICATION; RESOURCES,118,1,1,2,13,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,BERKELEY,"C/O JOURNALS & DIGITAL PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2000 CENTER ST, STE 303, BERKELEY, CA 94704-1223 USA",0731-1214,,,SOCIOL PERSPECT,Sociol.

Initially, the answer to this question was thought to lie in the individualistic ideological beliefs held by those going through foreclosure. That is, it was hypothesized that self-blame and guilt would account for the lack of activism in the streets. To test this hypothesis, a survey of over 400 residents and over twenty in-depth follow-up interviews were conducted in a working-class suburb of San Diego, California, that had been hard hit by the foreclosure crisis. These data failed to support the hypothesis and, instead, pointed to community individualistic ideology and lack of participation in civic organizations as the determining factors suppressing movement formation.",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,2013,56,1,foreclosure crisis; working class; social movements; civic organizations,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; MOBILIZATION; NONRESPONSE,45,3,3,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0731-1214,1533-8673,,SOCIOL PERSPECT,Sociol.

Focusing on the neglected relationship between the antislavery movement and black suffrage, the author reports that disruptive and militant activism, warfare, and partisan politics influenced this phenomenon. There also is support for a generational model of movement success. The evidence clarifies two unsettled issues: (1) whether movements matter and (2) the impacts of conventional, disruptive, and militant protest on movement success. Moreover, as institutionalism predicts, voting rules spread across states through mimicry; and as group threat theory predicts, free black presence adversely affected black suffrage.

In this study, the author investigates Asian American social movement organizations in metropolitan San Francisco and the relationship between single-ethnic and panethnic identities through in-depth interviews with social movement leaders in order to better understand how multiple identities are negotiated. Leaders of panethnic organizations actively and consciously work toward a panethnic movement identity that necessitates the maintenance of single-ethnic identification. Panethnicity and single-ethnicity are conceptualized as interlocking identity structures. The author argues that this new conceptualization of panethnic identity is made necessary as leaders acknowledge and attempt to address the ethnic and class hierarchies that exist within a diverse Asian American population.

These are (1) the partial recasting of dependency arguments in a critique of conventional clientelistic politics and government policy toward the poor, (2) the dismantling of traditional single-issue (i.e., Island political status) party politics in favor of an economic interest-based politics, and (3) an embrace of the rhetorical and coercive power of law.

The analysis shows that the interpretation of general economic problems is influenced strongly by the cultural context while offshoring is interpreted similarly in both countries. For actions targeting economic problems, thinking in economic models is very important in both countries.

In addition, they show that organizations with hybrid identities occupy relatively more central positions in interorganizational cocontact networks within the antiwar movement and thus recruit significantly more participants in demonstrations than do nonhybrid organizations.

But researchers often bracket the question of why some kinds of organizations are more likely than others to become targets of social movement pressure. We theorize the social production of targets by social movements, rejecting a simple reflection model to focus on configurations of power and vulnerability that shape repertoires of contention. Empirically, we extend structural accounts of global commodity chains and cultural accounts of markets to analyze the production of targets in the case of the anti-sweatshop movement of the 1990s. Using a longitudinal, firm-level dataset and unique data on anti-sweatshop activism, we identify factors that attracted social movement pressure to particular companies. Firms' power and positions strongly shaped their likelihood of becoming targets of anti-sweatshop activism. But the likelihood of being a target also depended on the cultural organization of markets, which made some firms more shamable than others.

Potential benefits include increased organizational innovation, legitimacy, and strategic capacity; challenges include threats to organizational stability, efficacy, and survival. In this article, we analyze the dynamics of internal diversity within a field of politically oriented civic organizations. We find that bridging cultural practices serve as a key mechanism through which racially and socioeconomically diverse organizations navigate challenges generated by internal differences. Drawing on data from extended ethnographic fieldwork within one local faith-based community organizing coalition, we describe how particular prayer practices are used to bridge differences within group settings marked by diversity. Furthermore, using data from a national study of all faith-based community organizing coalitions in the United States, we find that a coalition's prayer practices are associated with its objective level of racial and socioeconomic diversity and its subjective perception of challenges arising from such diversity. Our multi-method analysis supports the argument that diverse coalitions use bridging prayer practices to navigate organizational challenges arising from racial and socioeconomic diversity, and we argue that bridging cultural practices may play a similar role within other kinds of diverse organizations.",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2014,79,4,civil society; community organizing; organizational culture; racial and socioeconomic diversity; religion,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; PRAYER; COMMUNITY; IDENTITY; INVOLVEMENT; RELIGION,90,11,11,3,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

In this article we consider the role that residential segregation by education level plays in shaping perceptions of distributive justice and, in turn, providing a context conducive to conservative political mobilization.

As a result, we know little about why new census categories are defined in certain ways or how they become legitimated. This article addresses this gap by using an organizational lens to reconstruct how the Hispanic category emerged in the United States. I demonstrate that categories can become institutionalized through a two-stage process as state actors and ethnic entrepreneurs (1) negotiate a classification's definition and (2) work together to popularize the category. I argue that cross-field effects undergird these stages-movements toward developing a new category within state agencies are reinforced by similar classification efforts occurring among social movement groups and media firms, and vice versa. I identify three organizational mechanisms that sustained these effects in the Hispanic case: the development of boundary-spanning networks between state and non-state actors, the transposition of resources across fields, and the use of analogy and ambiguity as cognitive tools to describe and legitimate the new category.

The article identifies three ideal type power signatures in technology-enabled networks-highly concentrated, moderately concentrated, and dispersed. Different power signatures can result in similar political outcomes, suggesting that none of them represents a generally more effective way to organize power in networks.

"Russo, C","Russo, Chandra",ALLIES FORGING COLLECTIVE IDENTITY: EMBODIMENT AND EMOTIONS ON THE MIGRANT TRAIL,"This article examines how embodied experience and the accompanying emotions help social movement allies to forge collective identity. The analysis is based on the Migrant Trail, an annual protest event in which allies of the border-justice movement spend a week walking seventy-five miles through the U.S.-Mexico borderlands to protest migrant deaths. Original data include four years of participant observation, interviews conducted during the 2011 Migrant Trail, and surveys conducted a year and a half after the event. Findings suggest that embodied and emotional experiences help allies overcome challenges such as social distance from beneficiaries, a lack of credibility in the movement, and no lineage of resistance. This study contributes to an understanding of collective identity formation among allies and offers an illustrative case for the important role embodiment plays in the emotions of collective action.",MOBILIZATION,2014,19,1,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; COMMITMENT; CONSTRUCTION; BODY; PAIN,55,3,3,0,4,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,FEB,,AW1GD,WOS:000346037400004,4,.75

As these data show, the normal response to extreme oppression is a reliance on microsocial ties to secure survival; available resources are focused on the protection of those ties rather than committed to collective resistance. Under specific, contingent structural circumstances, however, an unequivocal perception of threat can align this desire to protect the microsocial unit with a commitment to collective action. In Piotrokow and Tarnow, structural factors counteracted the perception of immediate threat. The survival of the microsocial unit appeared to be best secured by individual strategies of action.

Internal challengers manage these dilemmas by rescripting existing stories and telling novel ones to navigate group boundaries and formulate new understandings of their individual and collective pasts, presents, and futures.

The results indicate that grievances involving a loss are perceived as more immoral, unjust, and important than grievances involving a gain. Loss-based grievances also generate stronger emotions, increase willingness to engage in activism, and produce perceptions of greater public support. Similarly, grievances resulting from a commission (action), as compared to an omission (inaction), are seen as more immoral, unjust, and important. Commission-based grievances direct attribution of blame toward perpetrators, evoke higher levels of emotions, and increase willingness to participate in campaigns.

Data, which were collected and coded using quantitative narrative analysis (QNA) software, take the form of inventories of tactics used by each movement. In spite of general contextual similarity in political opportunity and context faced by both movements, the inventory data reveal that each movement had its own overarching ""tactical disposition,"" which is understood as a relational pattern between challengers, publics, and authorities. Findings also suggest that the tactical dispositions of the movements initially formed in China and then migrated to diaspora, where they influenced further tactical decision making.

We highlight an alternative, less intuitive way in which movements can exert political influence: by targeting the corporate and institutional adversaries of their proposed reforms. Such targeting can undermine their adversaries' ability or commitment to oppose the changes, thus relaxing the contrary pressure applied to politicians and reducing the resistance within government to progressive reform. We support this proposition by highlighting five instances in which mass pressure applied to institutional adversaries contributed to government policy change. Our analysis demonstrates that mass protest targeting large institutions whose leaders are not elected can be an effective and even primary strategy for compelling elected officials to enact and implement progressive policy change.",MOBILIZATION,2014,19,3,,CIVIL-RIGHTS-MOVEMENT; ORGANIZATIONAL DIVERSITY; PUBLIC-OPINION; MOBILIZATION; IMPACT; CONSEQUENCES; STRATEGIES; ACTIVISM; OUTCOMES; TARGETS,131,3,3,0,12,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,SEP,,AW1GG,WOS:000346037700001,4,.75

This study therefore identifies repression's variegated forms and movements' corresponding responses using fifty-seven interviews with reform-oriented activists in Jordan, a ""liberalized"" authoritarian state, obtained in 2011. The findings demonstrate that activists (1) transformed softer repression into valued opportunities for communication with officials, and (2) responded to harder forms by publicizing repression through protests and their alliance networks, which persuaded the image-conscious regime to temper its tactics and prompted both sides to return to bargaining. This dynamic exemplifies a process of contained escalation, which helps to explain why Jordan's Arab Spring remained nonrevolutionary.

For all that is known about the diffusion of policies in a political context, less is understood about why some states ultimately end up with policies that are similar in structure, but vastly different in content. Do the forces that drive states to policy action also shape the content of the enacted policies? Examining the case of renewable energy policy among US states over a fourteen-year period, this paper addresses this question using event history analysis and an original longitudinal data set of state political and economic characteristics. State's energy economy, the presence of Democratic politicians, and environmental movement organizations are found to be important for determining the kind of policy a state ultimately enacts, while regional policy adoption explains why some states choose to enact largely symbolic renewable energy policies. Policy adoption should be conceptualized as a multifaceted process, with different factors acting as the impetus for action and others shaping the content of the policy. Understanding the nuanced roles of state characteristics and policy diffusion in the policy adoption process requires avoiding binary outcomes of passage or inaction in favor of simultaneously examining both policy action and policy content.",SOCIAL FORCES,2014,92,4,,ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS; HATE CRIME LAW; UNITED-STATES; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; ELECTRICITY POLICIES; INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE; PORTFOLIO STANDARDS; AMERICAN STATES; DIFFUSION; REFORM,78,5,5,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,,SOC FORCES,Soc.

Their work is insightful and informative, but it rarely uses general theory to describe the processes through which movement elements acquire legitimacy. Nor does it apply general theory to describe the mechanisms or processes through which legitimized elements influence collective action. The laboratory experiments reported in this article test hypotheses derived from a general theory-the multiple-sources, multiple-objects theory of legitimacy. The experiments examine the effects that legitimacy (measured as peer endorsement) and network size have on coalition formation, a form of collective action, and the countervailing of power. The research finds support for the legitimacy arguments. Low-power actors form coalitions more often in networks that highly endorse coalition formation and in smaller networks.

To account for this gender-violence link, we look beyond the social-movement literature by drawing on general strain theory within criminology. Using survey data of blacks taken during the peak of rioting in 1968, multivariate analyses support several hypotheses derived from general strain theory. One reason why black men are more likely than black women to riot is that men report much higher levels of police mistreatment and such individual-level strains are a strong predictor of riot participation. Because violence conflicts with gendered behavioral expectations and related socialization processes for women, we also find that women require high levels of a particular violence-inducing emotion (disappointment about racial progress) to be equally likely as men to be riot participants. These observations call for greater attention to micro-level strain and related emotions in the study of social-movement processes. Results also highlight the continued relevance of selective aspects of breakdown theories of the 1950s and 1960s. We conclude by speculating that the link between gender and rioting helps us understand why authorities and third parties reacted in such harsh and unsympathetic ways to the civil rights movement in the late 1960s.",SOCIAL FORCES,2014,93,1,,CIVIL-RIGHTS-MOVEMENT; LOS-ANGELES RIOT; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; COLLECTIVE ACTION; UNITED-STATES; CRIME; DELINQUENCY; ATTITUDES; VIOLENCE; PROTEST,92,4,4,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,,SOC FORCES,Soc.

Although social movements scholars have not theorized such interactions, ""strange bedfellows"" are not uncommon. They differ from coalitions in form, dynamics, relationship to larger movements, and consequences. I first distinguish types of relationships between movements based on extent of interaction and ideological congruence and describe the relationship between collaborating, ideologically opposed movements, which I call ""collaborative adversarial relationships."" Second, I differentiate among the dimensions along which social movements may interact and outline the range of forms that collaborative adversarial relationships may take. Third, I theorize factors that influence collaborative adversarial relationships' development over time, the effects on participants, and consequences for larger movements, in contrast to coalitions. I draw on the case of the relationship between anti-pornography feminists and conservatives during the 1980s, charting the dynamics of their interaction across arenas and over time.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2014,61,2,social movements; women's movement; pornography; coalitions; conservatism,SOCIAL-MOVEMENT; POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY; POLICY PROCESS; HEARINGS; RIGHTS; ORGANIZATIONS; PROTEST; WOMENS,68,9,9,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7791,1533-8533,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

Board of Education is considered a crowning achievement of racial equality yet, to date, there remains marked racial segregation in U.S. public schools. One explanation for continuing segregation lies in the reproduction of racialized institutions initially designed to preserve the color line. In this article, we examine the persistence of one such institution, drawing on historical institutionalism and rational choice theory to identify forces potentially linked to the reproduction of segregationist academies in the South. Using spatial analyses of National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data on public and private schools, we observe a process of the elite preservation of hierarchical advantage with linkages to former plantation economies, a legacy of lynching, and organization of white countermovement groups in response to civil rights mobilization. The findings highlight the reproduction of racialized institutions through organizational creation and adaptation and underscore the continuing relevance of spatial and temporal context in shaping specific manifestations of the color line.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2014,61,4,segregation; race; education; mobilization; social movement,PUBLIC-SCHOOL ENROLLMENT; WHITE FLIGHT; RACIAL VIOLENCE; HISTORICAL INSTITUTIONALISM; PRIVATE SCHOOLS; PATH DEPENDENCE; LEVEL ANALYSIS; UNITED-STATES; DESEGREGATION; EDUCATION,143,6,6,5,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7791,1533-8533,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

The literature suggests that collective identity and shared ideology both offer opportunities for bridging these differences, but few. have addressed their relative utility. Drawing on a case study of a university-based coalition of undocumented and citizen students working to build support for the federal DREAM Act, I find that a social justice ideology was used to facilitate fast-paced recruitment, create simplified participation guidelines based on legal status, and allow for the strategic renegotiation of participation. I argue that building a cross-status coalition through a shared ideology has two key advantages: (1) it allows for fast-paced coalition formation and (2) it promotes the mobilization and commitment of organizations and individuals who occupy different identities and social locations. Additionally, I suggest that conflict among members can be best negotiated through the development of discursive and interactive spaces that allow individuals to engage across their different social locations.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2014,61,2,social movements; coalitions; ideology; immigrant rights; undocumented youth,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; COLLECTIVE IDENTITY; POLITICS; PARTICIPATION; SUPPORT; PROTEST; WOMEN; PEACE,87,10,10,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7791,1533-8533,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

The two types of protest examined, referred to as conventional and unconventional forms of activism, are differentiated by differing levels of risk, demands, and political legitimacy. Methods The analysis uses multinominal logistic regression and data from the World Values Survey to assess the effects of a wide range of independent variables on participation in protest. Results The results indicate that participation in conventional forms of protest, activities that are relatively undemanding, socially legitimate, and low risk, tend to follow patterns that are consistent with participation in institutional politics. That is, participants in this form of activism tend to be socially privileged and ideologically moderate. Participants in unconventional protest, those that are highly demanding, socially illegitimate, or carry substantial risks, tend to be more ideologically extreme, socially disadvantaged, and more alienated from the conventional political system. Conclusions The findings in this study suggest that the lack of consistency in some existing research on protest participation may be attributable to differences in the predictors of participation associated with different forms of protest.

However, newly salient issues in a movement community can shift these boundaries by changing the membership criteria for both insiders and outsiders. Through a comparative case study of two relatively conservative feminist organizations, Women's Equity Action League (WEAL) and Feminists for Life (FFL), I examine how shifting boundaries around abortion rights in the feminist movement led to movement splintering, as organizations struggled and sometimes failed to maintain their relationships in a movement that increasingly defined them as outsiders. This analysis reveals how abortion rights' growing importance to both the feminist movement and the New Right resulted in the realignment of FFL with the feminist countermovement. This process had important consequences for both the organization and the countermovement with which it was realigned.

Evidence to answer this question is gathered from a year-length participant-observation case study of one city-based Tea Party organization, primarily through the meetings of its localized grassroots chapters. Principal findings are that Tea Party organizers employ quality control of off-message grievances, for example, abortion, as well as any action or communication that would or could be perceived as racially prejudicial, or otherwise inflammatory.

In contrast to claims that the marginalization of queer discourse is due to silencing by LGBT rights activists or to litigation strategies, we argue that variation in queer discourse over time is the result of the co-optation of queer discourse and goals by opponents. Extending the social movement literature on frame variation, we argue that opponents co-opt discourse when they adopt aspects of the content of a movement's discourse, while subverting its intent. We show that conservative LGBT rights opponents co-opted queer discourse. As a result, queer positions lost their viability as the discursive field in which those arguments were made was fundamentally altered. Because queer positions became less tenable, we see the withdrawal of queer discourse from the mainstream and alternative LGBT media. Our work both supports and builds on research on frame variation by demonstrating how discourse can change over time in response to the interplay between changing aspects of the political and cultural landscape and the discourse of opponents.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2014,29,4,co-optation; framing theory; lesbian and gay movement; LGBT rights; queer politics; same-sex marriage; social movements,SAME-SEX MARRIAGE; UNITED-STATES; MOVEMENT; GAY; IDENTITY; CITIZENSHIP; CRITIQUE; CHOICE; LIMITS,72,9,9,2,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

A Comparative Analysis of the Revolutionary Civil Wars in Russia, Finland, Spain, and China","According to classic interpretations of the communist revolutions, political mobilization of peasantry was critical for the success of the revolutionary forces. This article, which reexamines the experience of civil wars in Russia, Finland, Spain, and China, argues that peasants' contribution to the revolutions in Russia and later in China became possible under two historical conditions: breakdown of state authorities during the mass mobilization wars and existence of an unresolved agrarian problem in the countryside. Neither of these conditions alone, as the experience of other countries has shown, was sufficient for a success of the revolutionaries. The Spanish civil war of 1936-1939, for instance, was not preceded by a major international war. Because institutions of the traditional social order had not been undermined by war, Franco was able to defeat the Popular Front government, despite the peasants' support of the revolution. In the Finnish civil war of 1918, which broke out in the wake of World War I and the Russian Revolution, state institutions did not collapse completely and the peasantry was divided in their responses to the revolution; the rural smallholders, for example, aligned with the Mannerheim's White army, not with the urban revolutionaries.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2014,29,2,civil wars; communist revolutions; peasantry; political institutions; social movements; the state,RED; WHITE,113,1,1,3,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

Findings suggest substantial differences between those unions that are likely to appear in hearings on core labor-related topics and those that appear in hearings on broad social issues: AFL-CIO unions are more likely to participate in hearings on core labor issues, while unions commonly cited as revitalized and public sector unions are more likely to appear in hearings on broad social issues.",SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY,2014,84,2,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; AFL-CIO; ORGANIZATIONS; OPPORTUNITY; CHALLENGES; ECONOMY; STRIKES; THREAT; WIN,54,1,1,2,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-0245,1475-682X,,SOCIOL INQ,Sociol.

In light of our historical analysis, we argue that a synthesis of theories of institutional logics and social movements is useful in illuminating how the emergence of cosmopolitan commemoration is embedded in specific networks of political and civic actors as mobilizing structures, and how the content and trajectory of its articulation with nationalist commemoration depends on political opportunities available to competing networks aligned differently with the two logics of commemoration.",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,2014,57,2,collective memory; cosmopolitanism; nationalism; institutional logics; social movement,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; MEMORY,72,5,5,4,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0731-1214,1533-8673,,SOCIOL PERSPECT,Sociol.

First, this article discusses the opportunities available for citizens to participate in electoral politics. Volunteering is often limited to fund-raising and instrumental voter contacts given the constraints of electoral institutions. Although campaign volunteerism is a fundamentally limited form of civic engagement, institutional and partisan participation has democratic value. Campaigns are institutionally linked to political parties that offer distinct moral, ideological, and policy choices to citizens. Recent analytical and empirical work shows that contemporary political parties are constituted by relatively coherent networks of civil society and social movement organizations that devote considerable resources to electoral politics to shape primary and general election outcomes and advance their agendas in governance.

We find that union membership does not influence environmental concern in weaker economic times (1993 and 2010) but that it has a positive effect on environmental concern in stronger economic times (2000). Thus, union households are generally no less concerned about the environment than nonunion households.

To advance knowledge regarding how movement factions respond to frame transformation proposals, this paper examines an attempt to transform the central framing of the American pro-life movement. Over the past four decades, the American pro-life movement primarily employed a fetal rights frame. Yet a growing contingent of the pro-life movement is attempting to replace fetal-centric rhetoric with a frame claiming abortion is harmful to women. Using a combination of focus groups, interviews, and participant observation, this paper explains why this faction is challenging hegemonic pro-life framing and how more traditional pro-life actors respond. I argue that while ideological and organizational concerns often make transformation of a movement's central framing unlikely, if intramovement challengers can persuasively highlight the resonant appeal of challenging frames, movement colleagues are often willing to partially accommodate transformation requests by responding with frame extension.",SOCIOLOGICAL SPECTRUM,2014,34,2,,UNITED-STATES; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; MENTAL-HEALTH; ABORTION; EXTENSION; MOBILIZATION; ORGANIZATION; STRATEGIES; RESONANCE; PROTEST,79,3,3,1,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0273-2173,1521-0707,,SOCIOL SPECTRUM,Sociol.

Elites' power is not static or self-perpetuating but changing and dynamic. There are situations in which elites are forced into movement-like struggles to mobilize support from their community. The success of elites' mobilization is affected by cultural and structural factors that shape the collective meaning of supporting elites' actions and the identities that are formed in doing so.

Conceptualizing threat in spatial terms, they argue that group threat is activated through the joint occurrence of (1) proximity to threatening groups and (2) the population density of threatened groups. By analyzing the adoption of county and state dry laws banning alcohol from 1890 to 1919, they first show that prohibition victories were driven by the relative strength of supportive constituencies such as native whites and rural residents, vis-a-vis opponents such as Irish, Italian, or German immigrants or Catholics. Second, they show that threat contributed to prohibition victories: counties bordering large immigrant or urban populations, which did not themselves contain similar populations, were more likely to adopt dry laws. Threat arises primarily from interactions between spatially proximate units at the local level, and therefore higher-level policy change is not reducible to the variables driving local policy.",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,2015,121,2,,AMERICAN BREWING INDUSTRY; US WOMENS SUFFRAGE; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; UNITED-STATES; RELIGIOUS PLURALISM; CHURCH MEMBERSHIP; PROTEST WAVES; DIFFUSION; MOBILIZATION; MODEL,123,3,3,2,13,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0002-9602,1537-5390,,AM J SOCIOL,Am.

Drawing from social movement theory, we suggest a dynamic process through which contentious interactions lead to increased receptivity. We argue that when firms are chronically targeted by social activists, they respond defensively by adopting strategic management devices that help them better manage social issues and demonstrate their normative appropriateness. These defensive devices have the incidental effect of empowering independent monitors and increasing corporate accountability, which in turn increase a firm's receptivity to future activist challenges.

We investigate sit-in protest by black college students in the U.S. South in 1960, which targeted segregated lunch counters. An original dataset of 334 cities enables us to assess the effect of protest while considering the factors that generate protest itself-including local movement infrastructure, supportive political environments, and favorable economic conditions. We find that sit-in protest greatly increased the probability of desegregation, as did protest in nearby cities. Over time, desegregation in one city raised the probability of desegregation nearby.

Drawing on data from more than 15,000 protest events in the United States (1960 to 1995) and using quantitative methods, we find that law enforcement agents were less likely to show up at protests when general religious actors, actions, or organizations were present. Rather than reflecting privileged legitimacy, we find that this protective effect is explained by religious protesters' use of less threatening tactics at events. When religion is disaggregated into different traditions, only mainline and black Protestant groups have lower rates of policing than secular groups. As with the general religion finding, the buffering effect these traditions have on policing is mediated by protester tactics. Moreover, we find that fundamentalist Christians are more likely to be policed than are secular activists when threatening tactics are included. Finally, when actors associated with non-Christian religions engage in extremely confrontational tactics, they are more likely to provoke a police response than are similarly behaving secular groups.",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2015,80,6,religion; social movements; collective action; protest policing,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; REPRESSION; SOCIETY,50,1,1,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

"Bloom, J","Bloom, Joshua",The Dynamics of Opportunity and Insurgent Practice: How Black Anti-colonialists Compelled Truman to Advocate Civil Rights,"Political opportunity theory has proven extremely generative, highlighting the importance of macro-structural shifts in making established authorities vulnerable to insurgent challenge. But as critics point out, political opportunity theory flattens both culture and agency, and has fared poorly in explaining the timing of insurgency. Re-theorizing opportunity as leveraged by particular practices, rather than independently conferring to groups, redresses these limits, revealing the proximate causes of mobilization and influence. For a strategic test, this article revisits the forging ground of opportunity theory. Why did President Harry S. Truman, initially an apologist for the slow pace of racial reform in 1945-46, suddenly become an avid advocate of civil rights? Opportunity scholars argue that macro-structural forces caused Truman to advocate civil rights, generating the opportunity for insurgency by blacks as a group. But event structure analysis reveals how Black Anti-colonialist practices leveraged opportunities afforded by the earlier Progressive Challenge to compel Truman to adopt civil rights advocacy. Civil rights advocacy, in turn, allowed Truman to repress Black Anti-colonialist practices, even while setting the stage for the Civil Rights Movement to come. Different forms of insurgent practice leveraged opportunities created by different institutional cleavages; the same opportunities did not advantage all insurgency by a social group.",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2015,80,2,social movements; political opportunity; insurgency; event structure analysis; historical methodology,EVENT-STRUCTURE ANALYSIS; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY; CULTURE; REPERTOIRES; PROTEST; TRANSFORMATION; MOBILIZATION; SOCIOLOGY; ACTIVISM,111,3,3,2,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

To the best of our knowledge, scholars have not yet studied this aspect of protest participation. We start our study with a conceptualization and operationalization of protest atmosphere. Subsequently, we assess how demonstrators perceive atmosphere. Our analyses reveal that four types of protest atmospheres can be distinguished: harmonious, volatile, tense, and chaotic. We describe examples of these atmospheres and study why they are perceived.

It argues that, in addition to analyzing fluctuations in electoral support, scholars should also examine the degree to which extreme-right parties are able to express their views in the mass media. Supply-side explanations are extended by showing that discursive political opportunities need to be openly acknowledged and debated publicly to become relevant. Relying on longitudinal data derived from political claims analysis and opinion polls, this article demonstrates that negative public reactions significantly eroded the electoral attractiveness of the extreme-right party. In contrast, when one's goal is to achieve mass media access, the results reveal that any publicity is favorable publicity. Public criticism enhanced the CD's access to the public debate. Also, rising support in opinion polls led to more public claim making.

This mobilization featured women founding and joining community organizations, engaging in new forms of claims making toward state institutions, and eventually running for political office. Two mechanisms facilitated this process: the social appropriation of feminine values for the reconceptualization of women as legitimate political actors, and the brokerage of connections between individual women, organizations, and government institutions by foreign actors.

Of particular interest to scholarship on nonviolent movements, this article demonstrates the ways that, as the revolutionary wave spread around North Africa and the Middle East, protestors in states outside the original onset of the crisis overstated the possibilities of revolutionary success.

Using the Nonviolent and Violent Conflict Outcomes (NAVCO 1.1) data set, which includes aggregate data on 106 primarily nonviolent resistance campaigns from 1900 to 2006 with maximalist political objectives, we find that contemporaneous armed struggles do not have positive effects on the outcome of nonviolent campaigns. We do find evidence for an indirect negative effect, in that contemporaneous armed struggles are negatively associated with popular participation and are, consequently, correlated with reduced chances of success for otherwise-unarmed campaigns. Two paired comparisons suggest that negative violent flank effects operated strongly in two unsuccessful cases (the 8-8-88 challenge in Burma in 1988 and the South African antiapartheid challenge from 1952 to 1961, with violent flanks having both positive and negative impacts in the challenge to authoritarian rule in the Philippines (1983-1986) and the South African antiapartheid campaign (1983-1994).

Using a survey representing the adult population of the Reykjavk area (N = 610), I examine the role of perceived economic loss and political attitudes in protest behavior (controlling for biographical availability). I find that perceived financial loss predicts both protest participation and support, but only if individuals believe their losses to be greater than the losses of others.

Our analysis reveals that conflict within movements can benefit activists by fueling a radical flank effect and, in the end, helping activists achieve important political goals.

In order to understand this effect, it is important to look more broadly at what explains the persistence of contentious challengers. This study examines specific contentious challenges and assesses whether the challenger involved persisted by taking part in any subsequent challenges over the following twelve months. The results do not provide strong evidence of a direct, consistent impact of repression on persistence. However, the results consistently show that challengers are more persistent when they include organized groups, when they have staged previous challenges, when they seek regime change, when they oppose authoritarian regimes, and when they have mobilized more participants in protests. A key argument presented is that repression filters out less committed challengers, so that contentious challenges that emerge in more repressive situations are more persistent.",MOBILIZATION,2015,20,1,,COLLECTIVE ACTION; POLITICAL PROTEST; HUMAN-RIGHTS; CONFLICT; COERCION; VIOLENCE; STATES; COOPERATION; ESCALATION; DETERRENCE,61,0,0,1,10,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,MAR,,CJ2JN,WOS:000355310400004,3,0

The proposed framework can help to explain both the specific tactics chosen and whether campaigns take on violent or nonviolent forms. We focus on grievances and the origins of mobilization through formulation of claims-making disputes over regime type, government composition, and electoral legitimacy-independent of mobilization-and consider how resources provide a comparative advantage for violence or nonviolence.

I argue that undocumented youth strategically use storytelling for diverging purposes depending on the context, type of interaction, and audience involved. Based on ethnographic research, I show that storytelling allows them to incorporate new members, mobilize constituencies, and legitimize grievances. In each of these contexts, emotions play a key role in structuring the social transaction between storyteller and audience.

However, given the substantial variation across India and Brazil in culture, geography, and demography, the specific forms assumed by rightful radical resistance vary.

I argue that professional expertise, acquired through formalized training, and experiential expertise, gained through lived experience, provide unique and important support in claims making; highly resonant frames are often those built and maintained with both.

Extending prior formulations centered on the discrete impact of individual components of competition, we employ fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to precisely specify the conjunctural conditions governing two modes of Klan mobilization: public rally events and the establishment of local organizational units.

Empirical analyses utilize data from web surveys and semi-structured interviews collected from undocumented youth activists in California in 2011-2012. Findings indicate that LGBTQ activists encountered significant challenges to disclosing their sexual orientation. Yet these youth comprised a significant proportion of movement participants and they were more civically engaged than their straight peers. I argue that LGBTQ prominence among undocumented youth activists can, in part, be attributed to identity processes within this movement. Specifically, the recognition and activation of multiply marginalized identities at various levels of collective identity formation at the broader movement, organizational, and individual levels catalyzed intersectional mobilization, meaning high levels of activism and commitment among a disadvantaged subgroup within an already marginalized constituency. At the movement level, I show how the immigrant youth movement's adoption of the LGBTQ rights ""coming out"" strategy empowered undocumented youth around both their legal status and sexual orientation. This case of social movement spill-over produced a boomerang effect by promoting LGBTQ inclusivity among immigrants. At the organizational level, multi-identity work that addressed activists' overlapping identities created inclusive environments for LGBTQ members.

In advancing this claim, many have highlighted the role of domestic factors for example, generational change or economic affluence without fully accounting for the possibility that international dynamics may play an important role as well. The lack of work is surprising not only because the trend in protest is international in scope, but also because work in comparative sociology suggests globalization may make an important contribution. This study addresses the empirical gap by examining how political globalization (as measured by memberships in international organizations) and economic globalization (as measured by trade activity and foreign investment) influence trends in protest participation. Using data from World Values Surveys of 37,716 respondents in 17 advanced democracies merged with data on several national and international indicators, this study examines how the probability of participating in protest has changed over time as a result of these two forms of globalization. The results of multivariate, multilevel analysis combined with simulations indicate that trends in political globalization have expanded protest activity, while trends in economic globalization have limited that expansion.

We examine this thesis using multilevel data from the National Neighborhood Crime Study that provide sociodemographic and violence data for census tracts nested within 87 large cities.

Multilevel analyses reveal that the relationship between percentage black and violence varies substantially across cities, and that the average positive relationship often is attenuated, and reduced to statistical insignificance, in cities with favorable political contexts.

At the micro level, results from the Detroit Arab American Study (2003) show that personally experiencing repression enhances protest participation most strongly for those whose Arab identity is not especially salient. We interpret this finding to mean that such individuals experience repression as a moral shock and/or quotidian disruption and hence such encounters especially motivate them to protest. This is one of the first studies to demonstrate that repression can be especially mobilizing for those who under other circumstances would be least likely to protest. Our study pushes theorizing about repression by highlighting that the state is not the only actor who represses; that repression need not target protestors to affect the possibilities of protest; and that state and non-state repression is often tightly coupled for racial and ethnic minority populations.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2015,62,2,Arab American; repression; ethnic identity; protest; moral shock,SOCIAL-MOVEMENT; POLITICAL-PARTICIPATION; COLLECTIVE ACTION; WAR; MICROMOBILIZATION; SEPTEMBER-11; MOBILIZATION; BENEFITS; IDENTITY; VIOLENCE,83,4,4,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7791,1533-8533,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

MethodsWe utilize data from the March/April 2000-2010 Gallup Polls to examine how these two measures of identification with the environmental movement are related to membership in environmental organizations, attitudes toward the environmental movement, and private and public environmental behaviors. ResultsWhile both indicators similarly predict self-reported private environmental behaviors, the environmental movement identity indicator is more strongly associated with membership in environmental organizations and attitudes toward the environmental movement, and the self-identified environmentalist indicator is more strongly associated with self-reported public environmental behaviors. ConclusionsGiven the performance of the environmental movement identity measure, we lay out an agenda for future research using a slightly revised version of the indicator to investigate identification with a range of social movements via surveys of nationally representative samples of the general public.",SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY,2015,96,2,,COLLECTIVE IDENTIFICATION; PARTICIPATION,37,2,2,1,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4941,1540-6237,,SOC SCI QUART,Soc.

Motivated Reasoning and Debtors' Work to Accept Misinformation","How can people believe corporate and state misinformation even if a social movement organization in their community has been countering this misinformation for years? Why do people knowingly accept misinformation without even being upset about it? I address these questions by analyzing ethnographic data and interviews with 84 Chilean low-income housing debtors, whom, like many Chileans, are victims of financial misinformation. While the state and banks had significant agency in inducing the unproblematic acceptance of misinformation, debtors also played an active role in the processes. First, debtors had to decide whom to trust, which was not only a cognitive problem about evidence but also a behavioral and practical problem involving risks. Second, debtors engaged in ""motivated reasoning""-affect-driven biased information processing-to dismiss the possibility of being misinformed, to downplay the significance of misinformation, and to direct blame away from misinforming institutions. The latter two practices reduced debtors' anger about being misinformed. The findings have implications for studies of social movement framing and counterinformation, for the cognitive psychology of misinformation, and for the sociology and social psychology of acquiescence.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2015,30,4,Debt; framing and counterframing; misinformation; motivated reasoning; social movements; social psychology,CONTINUED INFLUENCE; MEMORY; JUSTIFICATION; CONTAMINATION,40,0,0,1,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

Our analysis found that cosmopolitanism was a central discourse, but it was also contested. Pittsburgh anarchists introduced an open-community cosmopolitanism that prioritizes the local over the global as a site of struggle and also embraces expansion of rights and commitment to diversity and inclusivity. Somewhat unexpectedly, this open-community cosmopolitanism was successfully transmitted beyond activist discourse into the public and the local media. The anarchist activist open-community framing challenged Pittsburgh residents to question whether increased global corporate investments were best for Pittsburgh and, in doing so, fostered connections between local anarchist activists, local journalists, and local Pittsburgh residents. To reflect on the ways that activists contribute to ideas of cosmopolitanism, this article presents a theoretical model that incorporates individual and collective dispositions and multiple ideological standpoints. We also show how movement groups may strategically draw on these shared cosmopolitan dispositions to expand their movement base, communicate their messages, and challenge the hegemony of global capitalism.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2015,30,1,anarchists; cosmopolitanism; global justice; media coverage; politics; social movements; summit protests,NEWSPAPER COVERAGE; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; PUBLIC SPHERE; HUMAN-RIGHTS; MEDIA; PROTEST; JUSTICE; COMMUNITARIAN; PERSPECTIVE; POLITICS,56,3,3,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

"Santoro, WA","Santoro, Wayne A.",Was the Civil Rights Movement Successful? Tracking and Understanding Black Views,"Was the modern civil rights movement successful? I depart from traditional approaches that judge success in terms of political inclusion and policy response and instead ask ordinary blacks what they thought. Using 1968 survey data, I find that while a slight majority (58%) believed that the movement successfully reduced racial discrimination, a sizable share (42%) saw failure. It seems most accurate to conclude that both perspectives resonated with large segments of the black population. I next examine who thought the movement a success and uncover that blacks of higher economic standing had the most faith in the movement's achievements. This result supports critics who thought that the poor were left behind by the movement's gains. Finally, while there was overall stability from 1968 to 2000 in opinion, the mid-1980s represented the nadir in thinking the movement successful. This development appears to have been a reaction to the racially hostile Reagan administration and the worsening economic position of blacks in the 1980s. Views on the civil rights movement, thus, are a living memory that can be altered by contemporary deleterious developments.

These racialized symbols enjoyed an undisputed claim to public squares and parks throughout the South. It was not until the late twentieth century that commemorations to the black freedom struggle were publicly supported. This analysis examines the institutionalization of counter-memories of the civil rights movement in Memphis, Tennessee at the Lorraine Motel, the site of the assassination of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The author draws on collective memory, cultural trauma, and social movements research as well as critical race theory to explain the creation of the National Civil Rights Museum. Using primary and secondary data sources the author examines how social memory agents, a changing political culture, and the passage of time mediated the cultural trauma of King's assassination and influenced the institutionalization of oppositional collective memories. Relying on Derrick Bell's interest-convergence principle, the author concludes that the creation of this major memorial museum was a result of the convergence of white and black interests, specifically the economic and political interests of white elites and the cultural and political interests of black symbolic entrepreneurs.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2015,30,2,civil rights movement; collective memory; counter-memories; interest-convergence theory; public commemoration; race,"COLLECTIVE MEMORY; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; KING,MARTIN,LUTHER; COMMEMORATION; IDENTITY; TOURISM; MYTH",85,4,4,1,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

Important change processes that were unfolding in Poland at the time of the French Revolution provide an instructive case. Although the contemporaneous French Revolution, with its enormous quantity and variety of collective mobilizations has been a touchstone for social movement scholars, the work of Poland's reform parliament and the adoption of Poland's 1791 constitution have gotten much less attention. Poland's reform politics not only provides both instructive parallels to and differences from French revolutionary developments, but were also deeply intertwined with them and embedded with those French events in a larger, European field of contention. Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of the Polish reform movement is that it was largely driven by elites, something noted in Karl Marx's bemused praise. Although social movements played very much less of a role in Poland than in France, we try to show here that familiar tools of social movement analysis permit an account of those Polish events as well.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2015,30,2,conflict; contentious politics; elites; identity; Poland; social movements,,56,0,0,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

Much theoretical work on racism examines how it has evolved during different historical periods, but this work does not address how these changing forms of racism affect social movement organizations, particularly those on the left. While the literature on color-blind ideology has examined how it is expressed by African Americans and European Americans separately, my work investigates how color-blind ideology operates when European Americans and people of color are working together in the same organizational setting. Studies of social movements have examined how organizational culture affects strategies but have neglected how external racist culture and color-blind ideology impacts organizational strategies. Findings from 3 years of ethnographic data collected on an interracial social movement organization and its corresponding coalition suggest that activists in interracial organizations use racism evasiveness strategically to maintain solidarity. I conceptualize racism evasiveness as the action resulting from color-blind ideology within a larger system of racism. While activists perceive advantages to these strategies, there are also long-term negative consequences. Without explicitly naming and addressing racism, progressive organizations may be limited in their ability to challenge systemic racism.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2015,30,1,racism; color-blind ideology; social movements; interracial; organizations; organizational culture,CIVIL RIGHTS; IDENTITY; RACE,42,5,5,1,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

"Andrews, KT; Gaby, S","Andrews, Kenneth T.; Gaby, Sarah",Local Protest and Federal Policy: The Impact of the Civil Rights Movementon the 1964 Civil Rights Act,"When and how do movements influence policy change? We examine the dynamics leading up to Kennedy's decision to pursue major civil rights legislation in 1963. This marked a key turning point in shifting the executive branch from a timid and gradualist approach. Although it is widely taken for granted that the civil rights movement propelled this shift, how the movement mattered is less clear. While most protest targeted local economic actors, movement influence was exerted at the national level on political actors. Thus, movement influence was indirect. We focus on the relationship between local movement efforts to desegregate public accommodations (restaurants, movie theaters, hotels, etc.) and federal responses to movement demands. Although exchanges between movement actors and the federal government took place throughout the period,the logic of federal response evolved as political actors sought strategies to minimize racial conflict. Specifically, the Kennedy administration shifted to a dual strategy. First, the Department of Justice attempted to promote voluntary desegregation by working with executives of national companies and civic groups. Second, administration officials worked with these same groups to build support for major legislation among key interest groups. This shift toward a more assertive and proactive intervention in civil rights stands in contrast to the pessimism regarding the prospects for federal policy only a few months earlier.

Groups such as Anonymous and WikiLeaks present researchers with difficulty in strict categorization and as such are often labeled in ways that obscure their classification and understanding. Situating these two groups within network society and social movement literatures, this study offers a sociological explanation for the rise of these groups and attempts to knit their disparately understood practices of hacktivism and journalism together in a coherent framework. Frame analysis is employed to examine how each group attends to core framing tasks, finding that both groups do so in substantially similar ways, employing complementary frames concerning the asymmetrical distribution of information. Moreover, their embeddedness in digital information networks, and their particular opposition to information asymmetry, acts as a unifying thread that enables these apparently disparate actors to be studied within a single analytical framework as part of an emerging digital, peer-produced movement concerned with the asymmetrical distribution of information.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2015,30,2,cyberactivism; framing; hacktivism; information asymmetry; social movements; WikiLeaks and Anonymous,SOCIAL-MOVEMENT; ORGANIZATION; MARKET; MEDIA,70,3,3,2,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

However, most of the accounts of these divisions have tended to emphasize relatively recent events or trends, such as the Tea Party movement or the extreme partisanship that has marked the last three presidential administrations (e.g., Obama, George Bush Jr., Clinton). The origins of today's divisions, however, have much older roots. They date to the heyday of the Civil Rights struggle and ironically to the seminal achievements of the movement. More accurately, it is the story of not one, but two parallel movements, the revitalized civil rights movement of the early to mid-1960s and the powerful segregationist countermovement, that quickly developed in response to the African-American freedom struggle. The argument is that over the course of the decade of the 1960s, these two linked struggles decisively altered the partisan geography of the United States, and in the process pushed the national Democratic and Republican parties sharply to the left and right, respectively, undermining the centrist policy convergence of the postwar period and setting the parties on the divisive course they remain on today.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2015,30,,civil rights; inequality; political party; race; social change; social movement,ACT; MOVEMENT; IMPACT; LEGACY,25,11,11,2,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

A critical question arises: What does happen when a revolutionary movement's ideology drastically contradicts with the movement's local pragmatic purposes? Analyzing Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in Turkey, this article explores the complex process of ideological transformation under the forces of local competition. Drawing on Mikhail Bakhtin's dialogic approach, I introduce the concept of symbolic localization to understand how revolutionary ideologies evolve through pragmatic concerns. Symbolic localization refers to a discursive process of collective reputation work in which social movement activists blend local cultural repertoires and their we identity in order to build recognition, legitimacy, and prestige in the eyes of local population. Three major mechanisms of the symbolic localization process are identified: moral authority building, public symbolism, and memory work.

Metropolitan-level CBCO federations provide a novel and noteworthy example of meso-mobilization contexts as described in the social movement literature in that many such federations engage in multiple concurrent issue campaigns. This study examines collaboration among organizational members of Communities Creating Opportunity, a CBCO federation based in Kansas City, Missouri. Qualitative interviews with organizers, clergy, and lay-leaders, together with an analysis of organizational records, reveal a cooperative structure of interorganizational relations built upon specific organizing activities, roles, and relations. These activities, roles, and relations are in turn conditioned on each member organization's own level of connection to a particular organizing issue. Findings suggest that this innovative form of cooperative relational structure affords multi-issue federations an enhanced capacity to mobilize voluntary labor resources and turn-out at public events relative to single issue organizing.",SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY,2015,85,1,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; COALITION; MESOMOBILIZATION; ORGANIZATIONS; MOBILIZATION; BOUNDARIES; CAMPAIGNS; DIVERSITY; PROTEST; POWER,46,1,1,1,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-0245,1475-682X,,SOCIOL INQ,Sociol.

Drawing on value-expectancy theory, we provide an integrated theory to predict direct and conditional effects of efficacy and perceptions of structural disadvantage and injustice on collective action within countries. To address the limitations of previous research, we use cross-national data of 29 countries, including economically advanced and less advanced nations, to test how well these hypotheses explain within-country variation in collective action. We find that internal efficacy is significantly and positively associated with low- and moderate-cost collective action, whereas organizational embeddedness, a proxy for political efficacy, is significantly and positively associated with low-, moderate-, and high-cost collective action. Perceptions of legitimate and unjust structural disadvantage are also positively associated with all types of collective action. Importantly, the positive effects of both types of efficacy on high-cost collective action are conditional on perceptions of structural injustice. That is, participation in high-cost collective action is more likely for those who are both efficacious and perceive structural disadvantage as unjust.",SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY,2015,85,3,,SELF-RATED HEALTH; PROTEST PARTICIPATION; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; RESOURCE MOBILIZATION; POLITICAL-ACTION; IDENTITY; IDENTIFICATION; NETWORKS; ACTIVISM; CONTEXT,68,5,5,3,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-0245,1475-682X,,SOCIOL INQ,Sociol.

Yet activist groups may function as particularly intensive training grounds for future participation by developing members' political consciousness and engaging them in political processes.

"Banerjee, T; Murray, J","Banerjee, Tarun; Murray, Joshua",What Shapes Corporate Involvement in Voter Referendums? The Case of Opposition to GM Food Labeling,"What propels the involvement of large U.S. corporations into statewide voter referendums? We test the argument of whether corporate political behavior is characterized by firm-level factors or more relational sectoral and classwide networks. Using the 2012 ballot proposition to mandate labeling of genetically modified (GM) foods in California as a case, we analyze corporate donation patterns. We find that while individual interests are significant predictors of involvement, these are eclipsed by relational factors.

"Bloemraad, I","Bloemraad, Irene",THEORIZING AND ANALYZING CITIZENSHIP IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES,"I argue that sociologists have directed insufficient attention to the study of citizenship. When citizenship is studied, sociologists tend to concentrate on just one facet: rights. I elaborate four conceptual facets of citizenship. I link two-citizenship as rights and belonging-to theoretical elaborations of multiculturalism. Considering multiculturalism as a state discourse and set of policies, rather than a political or normative theory, I outline linkages between multiculturalism and two additional facets of citizenship: legal status and participation. Over the last 15 years, the idea of multiculturalism has come under withering criticism, especially in Europe, in part because it is claimed that multiculturalism undermines common citizenship. Yet countries with more multicultural policies and a stronger discourse of pluralism and recognition are places where immigrants are more likely to become citizens, more trusting of political institutions, and more attached to the national identity. There is also little evidence that multicultural policies fuel majority backlash, and some modest evidence that such policies enlarge conceptions of inclusive membership. By studying claims-making and the equality of immigrant-origin groups, we see that the participatory aspect of citizenship needs to take center stage in future work in political sociology, social theory, social movements, immigration, and race/ethnicity.",SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY,2015,56,4,,IMMIGRATION; POLICY; DIVERSITY; CANADA,57,3,3,5,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-0253,1533-8525,,SOCIOL QUART,Sociol.

Through a comparative study of six newspaper organizations in the three coastal cities of Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai, the article demonstrates the significance of local field environment for critical news reporting. The findings reveal how site-specific field environments can alternately enable or constrain collective resistance in an authoritarian context.

However, not all grievances are equal in this respect. We distinguish between structural grievances that flow from incumbency in a subordinate social position and incidental grievances that incumbents have no expectation of suffering. Based on a case-control analysis of incidents of mutiny compared with controls drawn from a unique database of Royal Navy voyages from 1740 to 1820, in addition to a wealth of qualitative evidence, we find that mutiny was most likely to occur when structural grievances were combined with incidental ones.

Existing explanations use reflection models of parties, whereby parties reflect preexisting cleavages or institutional arrangements. But a comparison with Canada, whose political terrain was supposedly more favorable to labor parties, challenges reflection models. Newly compiled electoral data show that underlying social structures and institutions did not affect labor party support as expected: support was similar in both countries prior to the 1930s, then diverged. To explain this, I propose a modified articulation model of parties, emphasizing parties' role in assembling and naturalizing political coalitions within structural constraints. In both cases, ruling party responses to labor and agrarian unrest during the Great Depression determined which among a range of possible political alliances actually emerged. In the United States, FDR used the crisis to mobilize new constituencies. Rhetorical appeals to the forgotten man and policy reforms absorbed some farmer and labor groups into the New Deal coalition and divided and excluded others, undermining labor party support. In Canada, mainstream parties excluded farmer and labor constituencies, leaving room for the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) to organize them into a third-party coalition.",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2016,81,3,class conflict; political parties; trade unions; organizations; social movements; labor; working class; agrarian protest,HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY; AGRICULTURAL POLICY; AMERICAN LABOR; POWER; DEAL; REFLECTIONS; AUTONOMY; FARMERS; INDIA,191,1,1,4,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

Our results show that multi-issue protest events are more likely to use novel recombinations of tactics, and protest events with more peripheral movement claims tend to introduce new protest tactics.

Results from event history and logistic regression analyses show, first, that communities lying above favorable areas of the shale did not pass anti-fracking laws because opposition to fracking was counteracted by significant local support for development. Fracking bans passed primarily in a geographic sweet spot on the periphery of targeted regions, where little or no compelling economic interest in development existed. Second, as fracking became the subject of a highly politicized national debate, local opposition increasingly reflected mobilization by political liberals.

Why did the Barack Obama administration not produce the lasting leftwing mobilizations characteristic of the Franklin Roosevelt era? To address these questions and locate these episodes in historical perspective, we elaborate a political reform model, a macro-political theory that explains variance in movement presence. At its core, the political reform model holds that highly partisan political regimes and policy enactments interact to spur the presence of movements. We illustrate the argument and place these episodes in historical perspective with data from the Political Organizations in the News Project on all national movement organizations appearing in four major newspapers across 115 years. Historical analyses indicate that all periods of right or left partisan dominance, including leftwing partisanship under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s and Republican dominance in the 1920s and 1980s, induced waves of movement coverage, regardless of whether there was an economic crisis.

We develop a theory of discursive eruption, referring to the ability of radical movements to initially ignite media coverage but not control the content once other actors-particularly those that can take advantage of journalistic norms-enter the discourse. We hold that one long-term outcome of radical social movements is the ability to alter discursive fields through mechanisms such as increasing the salience and content of movement-based issues. We examine the way movements shape discourse by focusing on newspaper articles about inequality before, during, and after the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement. We analyze changes in the salience and content of coverage as well as shifts in actor standing and influence. Using 7,024 articles from eight newspapers, we find that the OWS movement increased media attention to inequality, shifting the focus of the discourse toward movement-based issue areas (e.g., the middle class and minimum wage). Further, we find that compared to the pre-OWS period, the influence of social movement organizations and think tanks rose in discourse on inequality. In addition, the discourse on inequality became more highly politicized as a result of the Occupy movement. These findings highlight the importance of social movements in shaping discourse and indicate that social movement scholars should further consider discursive changes as a consequence of social movements.",MOBILIZATION,2016,21,4,,NEWSPAPER COVERAGE; MEDIA ATTENTION; PROTEST EVENTS; UNITED-STATES; MASS-MEDIA; ORGANIZATIONS; DIFFUSION; DYNAMICS; POLICY; AGENDA,60,2,2,3,11,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,DEC,10.17813/1086-671X-21-4-413,EJ3DM,WOS:000393092800003,2,1

HOW SOCIAL MOVEMENT ALLIES AFFECT THE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION IN THE US CONGRESS,"This article considers the role of social movement allies in Congress in advancing pro-environmental legislation. We argue that compared to sponsors of legislation who hold moderate views, sponsors with extreme ideological positions will be less likely to produce legislation desired by the environmental movement. We also argue that protest and organizational advocacy by constituents will increase the rate at which sponsors enact environmental legislation. Using event history techniques that follow over 12,000 environmental bills from 1973-1996, we find support for the argument that environmental bills are more successful when sponsored by legislators who have environmental voting records closer to the median voter in Congress, compared to bills sponsored by representatives holding more extreme positions.

"Gentile, A","Gentile, Antonina",WORLD-SYSTEM HEGEMONY AND HOW THE MECHANISM OF CERTIFICATION SKEWS INTRA-EUROPEAN LABOR SOLIDARITY,"This article uses ethnographic methods, archival research, and systematic process tracing to suggest how McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly's certification mechanism helps to explain systemic impediments to docker solidarity during the EU docker's campaign, 2001-3. By cross-referencing semistructured interviews across docker INGOs and unions in nine OECD countries and triangulating those interviews with internal communications, I found that although the leaders of the International Transport Workers' Federation and the European Transport Workers' Federation were keen to cooperate with leaders of the competing International Dockers Council, national unions affiliated to the ITF/ETF possessed a special power to prevent cooperation. The ""national sovereignty clause"" in the ITF/ETF constitution endows existing affiliates of the ITF/ETF with the power to veto applications for affiliation by other unions in their national domain. It also can prevent ITF/ETF leaders from communicating with those excluded unions and their representatives. Thus, ITF/ETF certification is founded, not on mutual recognition among all groups of workers, but rather in the denial of recognition to some. This study traces the origins of the clause to the post-WWII construction of the US-led hegemonic order, when ITF leaders colluded with the American Federation of Labor in dividing labor worldwide along Cold War lines. The study identifies the by-pass mechanisms that today's ETF leaders used and which temporarily enabled cooperation across the INGO divide. It also detects a long-term uneven and unequal representation of southern European unions that can skew the frames and goals of a campaign to reflect the interests of more solidly represented regions of labor. This analysis shows that the study of labor transnationalism is enriched by a combination of ethnographic and indepth historical inquiry, which can help us avoid the Kantian imperatives that seeped into the study of transnational actors after the end of the Cold War. And it shows that, by pushing us deeply behind ""campaign time,"" the combination of ethnography and archival sleuthing helps students of contentious politics to detect longer processes and bigger power structures than we have been apt to do-structures such as world orders established by a hegemonic state.",MOBILIZATION,2016,21,1,,TRADE-UNION CONFEDERATION; COLD-WAR; UNITED-STATES; MOVEMENT; HISTORY; WATERFRONT; DIPLOMACY; ORDER,55,0,0,0,4,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,MAR,10.17813/1086-671X-21-1-105,DN0OO,WOS:000376763400006,2,0

Using an error correction model, we demonstrate that social movement events have a significant effect on gender attitudes.

To date, little attention has been directed toward tactics that have disappeared from movement repertoires. Using interview data, I find that glitter bombing declined due to many of the same factors that initially provided momentum for its diffusion. First, it was specific to LGBT rights to the degree that the audience of potential adopters was limited. At the same time, the radical nature of glitter bombing meant that adopters were peripheral movement actors who lacked organizational support. Activists dedicated limited resources to gaining media attention and online popularity, often at the cost of other crucial aspects of mobilization. Finally, an increase in repression multiplied these challenges by posing risks to adopters and shifting media coverage away from the tactic's celebratory framing.",MOBILIZATION,2016,21,3,,PRO-CHOICE MOVEMENT; POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES; SELECTION BIAS; PROTEST EVENTS; NUCLEAR-POWER; GAY MOVEMENT; DIFFUSION; ORGANIZATIONS; MEDIA; MOBILIZATION,108,0,0,1,3,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,SEP,10.17813/1086-671X-20-3-259,EJ3DK,WOS:000393092600001,2,0

Do they converge on a type that Tilly called ""strong,"" which is closer to the rigid end of the spectrum, as Tilly expected? What accounts for the differences across countries and over time in the flexibility of repertoires? Do political opportunity or resource mobilization theories explain the variation? To address these questions, I create measures from data on contentious events worldwide between 1990 and 2004 provided by the World Handbook of Political Indicators IV. I find that the flexibility of repertoires does indeed cluster around Tilly's strong model.

Whereas most social movement literature has addressed this question in the US context for policy change outcomes, this paper takes a different approach by bringing the question to a global context and examines democratization as a structural outcome. Accordingly, we test several hypotheses about the ephemeral, positive, and negative influences of contentious collective action on the democratization process in a given country, as well as the cross-border effect of the contention. To go beyond the limitations of previous studies, this paper uses a monthly time-series, cross-national model to examine potential liberalizing or deliberalizing effects of protest activities. Using data from 103 non-democratic countries from 1990 to 2004, we find that protests and riots increase the probability that a country will liberalize in a given month. We find that while contentious events in other countries do not directly increase the risk of liberalization, external contentious events, especially those that lead to political liberalization, increase the count of contentious events, thus indirectly boosting liberalization. We find no evidence that protest significantly increases the chances of deliberalization.

Doing so, however, can also undermine support for their claims. We argue that how protestors weigh this trade-off depends on their targets and the extent to which their claims appeal to diverse constituencies, which then factors greatly into their choice of protest tactics. We complement past work that suggests that forces of professionalization and counter pressure alter activists' tendency to use violent and disruptive tactics. With data on over 23,000 protest events in the United States between 1960 and 1995, we find that protest events characterized by broadly resonating claims are more likely to employ tactics that are disruptive but nonviolent. By contrast, events espousing narrower claims are more likely to employ disruptive tactics that are also violent. Moreover, when governmental entities are targeted, protests are less likely to witness the use of both violent and nonviolent disruptive tactics.

Frame Resonance, Political Ideology, and the Immigrant Rights Movement","Although social movement scholars in the United States have long ignored activism over immigration, this movement raises important theoretical and empirical questions, especially given many immigrants' lack of citizenship. Is the rights ""master"" frame, used extensively by other US social movements, persuasive in making claims for noncitizens? If not, which other movement frames resonate with the public? We leverage survey experiments-largely the domain of political scientists and public opinion researchers-to examine how much human/citizenship rights, economics, and family framing contests shape Californians' views about legalization and immigrants' access to public benefits. We pay particular attention to how potentially distinct ""publics,"" or subgroups, react, finding significant differences in frame resonance between groups distinguished by political ideology. However, alternative framings resonate with-at best-one political subgroup and, dauntingly, frames that resonate with one group sometimes alienate others. While activists and political theorists may hope that human rights appeals can expand American notions of membership, such a frame does not help the movement build support for legalization. Instead, the most expansive change in legalization attitudes occurs when framed as about family unity, but this holds only among self-reported conservatives. These findings underscore the challenges confronting the immigrant movement and the need to reevaluate the assumption that historically progressive rights language is effective for immigrant claims-making.",SOCIAL FORCES,2016,94,4,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; PUBLIC-OPINION; UNITED-STATES; ATTITUDES; SUPPORT; CITIZENSHIP; EUROPE; IMPACT; POLICY,64,5,5,3,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,,SOC FORCES,Soc.

Why do some citizens but not others approve when activists use protest tactics? This is a crucial but poorly understood aspect of social movements. While most prior research has focused on the personal determinants of attitudes toward movements, we argue that proximity to protest may cultivate positive views about a movement. Individuals living near centers of movement activity may become more favorable to protest because they become more sympathetic to the demands of activists. We investigate public support about protest tactics among white Southerners during the early stages of the civil rights movement. To do so, we employ a representative survey conducted in 1961 with nearly 700 white adults living in the South. These survey data are combined with contextual data measuring local protest, political behavior, and civic organizations. Most scholars have focused on the ways that civil rights activity propelled white counter-mobilization, but protest also won sympathy from a small subset of white Southerners, thereby fracturing the dominant consensus in support of Jim Crow segregation. We also find that local racial political context matters: individuals living in counties with weaker support for segregationist politics, where white moderates were active, and outside the Deep South were generally more favorable. At the individual level, our strongest findings indicate that sit-in support was more likely from those with greater educational attainment, less frequent church attendance, and exposure to discussions about race relations from the pulpit.",SOCIAL FORCES,2016,94,3,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; PUBLIC-OPINION; POLITICAL TOLERANCE; BLACK PROTEST; EARLY 1960S; SIT-INS; POLICY; EDUCATION; IMPACT; ORGANIZATIONS,95,1,1,8,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,,SOC FORCES,Soc.

"Seguin, C","Seguin, Charles",Cascades of Coverage: Dynamics of Media Attention to Social Movement Organizations,"Gaining attention in the mass media is a key goal of many social movement organizations (SMOs). The dominant explanation of media attention to SMOs is that the media act like a filter, selecting some types of SMOs and events for attention, and ignoring others based on characteristics of these SMOs, events, and their political environment. In contrast to this ""bias model,"" I argue that some media attention to SMOs is characterized by positive feedback, or rich-get-richer processes: past media attention increases the likelihood of future media attention through its effect on the SMO and on other media outlets. Like other positive feedback systems, media attention can be path dependent, is routinely punctuated by large cascades of attention to previously obscure SMOs, and can be contingent on ""accidents"" of history: at critical junctures, individuals, organizations, and events have the potential to radically impact the extent of media attention to their movements and organizations. Media attention to SMOs can also become decoupled from the types of events that initially sparked their media attention, becoming spokes-organizations for their movements and receiving media attention for events and stories that they themselves are not involved. In support of this theory, I first show that media attention is, similar to other positive feedback processes, power-law distributed across SMOs using two national (US) data sets.

To address these questions this article examines renewable energy policy instrument adoption by U.S. states and argues that states adopt instruments of different types based on their state-level economic, political, institutional, and cultural characteristics. I test these claims by examining the tax incentive-and regulatory mandate-based policy instruments adopted to promote renewable energy generation by U.S. states over a 40-year period. Using random effects Poisson regression analysis, I find that state affluence, environmental movement organization density, and fossil fuel production predict the number of policies a state is likely to adopt, while an affinity for a neoliberal ideology, U.S. senators environmental voting records, and prior policy actions predict the types of policies a state adopts. These results reinforce perceptions of economic factors as key predictors of renewable energy policy, but also highlight the importance of less frequently examined cultural factors for explaining a state's portfolio of policies.

Borrowing from organizational studies, some of these scholars have used the term decoupling to conceptualize the widespread phenomenon of states that sign conventions but do not implement these conventions' norms. In this article, we introduce the concept of differentiated decoupling, arguing that the implementation of human rights norms needs to be rethought and reoperationalized. We present a case study-the right to vote in the United States-to illustrate our argument that it is vital to disaggregate the decoupling processes and examine the different social groups within the state rather than limit scrutiny to the state level. We further contend that in order to explain differentiated decoupling, perspectives developed and used by sociologists who study inequality need to be adopted. In this way, scholars can capture the unequal distribution of human rights in domestic settings and begin to untangle the forces leading to differentiated decoupling. An analysis of differentiated decoupling helps reveal that ""more human rights"" sometimes means more human rights to one group and less to another, suggesting that implementation of human rights norms may even deepen stratification.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2016,63,4,human rights; decoupling; implementation; sociology of inequality; the right to vote,INTERNATIONAL HUMAN-RIGHTS; FELON DISFRANCHISEMENT; PERSONAL INTEGRITY; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; UNITED-STATES; LIFE-COURSE; INCARCERATION; SOCIOLOGY; RACE; CONSEQUENCES,90,1,1,1,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7791,1533-8533,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

What provoked this unexpected development? This article analyzes the Colombian informal recycler movement-a ""least likely"" case for successful mobilization due to the recyclers' extreme marginality and the Colombian state's violent repression of labor movements. The article argues that the rise of neoliberalism and the consolidation of democracy created political opportunities that conventional perspectives on the informal economy would not lead us to expect. Three specific links connected these macro-level transformations to increases in the recyclers' collective organizing capacity. First, technical, financial, and symbolic backing from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) enabled recyclers to develop innovative organizing models. Second, new human rights provisions contained in the Constitution of 1991 created an opening to challenge state policy. Third, the privatization of waste management spurred recyclers to action by leaving them with two clear-cut possibilities: waste corporations might permanently displace them, or recyclers might collectively organize to protect and improve their livelihoods.",SOCIAL PROBLEMS,2016,63,3,informal workers; labor movements; economic development; recyclers; neoliberalism,LATIN-AMERICA; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; CIVIL-SOCIETY; RIGHTS; ORGANIZATIONS,92,1,1,1,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7791,1533-8533,,SOC PROBL,Soc.

I argue that social movement policy implementation is also shaped by bureaucrats' tacit understandings of key movement concepts, albeit conditioned by how able they feel to implement those interpretations in light of political contexts. I make this argument through the case of government agency environmental justice (EJ) grant programs, analyzing program documents, funding patterns, and confidential interviews with agency representatives to explain why most EJ grant programs deviate from longstanding EJ movement priorities while one program coheres with them. I show that these outcomes stem from the fact that many staff-even while avowing support for EJ policy-hold tacit understandings of key movement concepts that differ from those of advocates.

Using data on Libyan and Syrian activism in the United States and Great Britain, this study demonstrates that they do through violence, exile, threats, surveillance, and by harming dissidents' relatives at home. The analysis finds that the transnational repression of these diasporas deterred public anti-regime mobilization before the Arab Spring. I then identify the mechanisms by which Libyans and Syrians overcame these effects during the 2011 revolutions. Activists ""came out"" when (1) violence at home changed their relatives' circumstances and upset repression's relational effects; (2) the sacrifices of vanguard activists expanded their objects of obligation, leading them to embrace cost sharing; and (3) the regimes were perceived as incapable of making good on their threats. However, differences in the regimes' perceived capacities to repress in 2011 produced significant variation in the pace of diaspora emergence over time and guarded advocacy.

Drawing on interviews with 19 U.S. sex worker rights activists conducted between 2010 and 2012, and participant observation of a national sex worker rights conference in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2010, I illustrate how activists create sex worker rights frames that (1) contest the labeling of sex workers as victims and (2) contest the accuracy and emotionality of stories and statistics used in mainstream anti-sex trafficking efforts. This rights-based framing draws on two master frames, labor rights and equal rights, to redefine the criminalization and stigmatization of sexual labor as a social problem, rather than prostitution itself. In the framing conflict over sex work, a rights-based approach also problematizes the intent and outcomes of anti-sex trafficking efforts to protect and rescue. To the extent that U.S. policy and advocacy efforts assume that sex work is a social problem and morally reprehensible, and that abolition of prostitution is a sound goal, those who challenge these assertions are at a disadvantage for acquiring credibility, voice, and support.",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,2016,59,1,sex work; prostitution; framing; social change,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; UNITED-STATES; PROSTITUTION; POLITICS; TRADE; WOMEN; LABOR,64,4,4,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0731-1214,1533-8673,,SOCIOL PERSPECT,Sociol.

"Dodson, K","Dodson, Kyle",Economic Threat and Protest Behavior in Comparative Perspective,"Resurgent interest in the role of economic threat in fostering movement participation has highlighted the importance of economic change. However, many of the insights of this approach are drawn from case studies of specific movements. Comparative research on economic threat has been relatively absent, leaving open the possibility that the influence of threat is limited to certain contexts. To remedy the empirical gap, this study takes advantage of a standardized, cross-national dataset (the 2004 International Social Survey Programme) to evaluate the recent claims. Using changes in the unemployment rate as a measure of economic threat, the results suggest that the mobilizing effects of economic uncertainty are strongest among those individuals who are most vulnerable to economic changein this case, manual workers in liberal welfare states. By contrast, workers with more economic protectioneither by virtue of their occupational position or their access to a more generous welfare systemare largely unresponsive to changing labor market conditions. The findings highlight the relevance of two sources of economic protection: social class at the individual level and welfare policies at the national level. The importance of focusing on the intersection of these levels and the benefits of a comparative approach to understanding the emergence of economic threat are discussed in conclusion.",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,2016,59,4,social movements; social class; welfare state,UNITED-STATES; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; WELFARE-STATE; POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES; RESOURCE MOBILIZATION; INCOME INEQUALITY; GERMANY; FRANCE; REDISTRIBUTION; INSTITUTIONS,74,1,1,2,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0731-1214,1533-8673,,SOCIOL PERSPECT,Sociol.

This article examines how one Israeli women's human rights organization, MachsomWatch (MW), succeeded at providing direct aid to Palestinians, intervening with the military and established media standing. This article explains that MW was most successful when it maintained a nonthreatening insider disposition that drew on distinctly particularistic cultural norms in interactions with the soldiers in ways that emphasized their commonality with the soldiers due to their shared ethnic, religious, and national origins. This analysis suggests that it is productive for movement scholars to think of movement targets as agentic actors who are networked together in ways that may sometimes be permeable to certain groups of activists.

We do this by constructing an interaction term between HINGO concentration and level of democracy. As a result, we find that democracy moderates the effect of HINGOs on TB. Higher concentrations of HINGOs within developing nations are correlated with a larger beneficial effect on tuberculosis mortality in nations with high levels of democracy versus more repressive nations.

These processes are evident in the rapid unraveling of the Chinese state early in the Cultural Revolution. Portrayed in past accounts as a culmination of student and worker insurgencies, an early 1967 wave of power seizures was in fact accelerated by an internal rebellion of bureaucrats against their own superiors. These led to the widespread collapse of local governments, diverting the course of the Cultural Revolution and forcing intervention by the armed forces. An event-history analysis of the diffusion of power seizures across a hierarchy of 2,215 government jurisdictions portrays a top-down cascade that spread deeply into rural regions with few students and workers and little popular protest.

The fundamental similarity of rising activism for all three groups supports the world society thesis, but in-depth examination of concrete mechanisms unpacks complex global-local interplay and reveals intranational diversity in the impact of global human rights.

But organizations also comprise a primary context where people form social ties. We investigate how the network structure an organization creates among its members influences its ability to grow and reproduce. In particular, we propose that two dimensions of organizational strategy influence affiliation dynamics: (1) the extent to which an organization induces social interaction among its members (social encapsulation), and (2) the time and energy that an organization demands of its members (time and energy demand). We examine membership dynamics in an ecology where competitor organizations deploying varied strategies vie for the same pool of members. Results show a curvilinear relationship between membership growth and the rate of social encapsulation. Furthermore, we find that time and energy demand mediates the effect of social encapsulation by shaping its members' opportunities for maintaining external affiliations. Different opportunity structures result in different levels of network turnover, thus either reinforcing or dissolving intra-organizational ties. For most types of organizations, attaining sustained growth requires a balance between open networks (for recruitment) and network closure (for retention).",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2017,82,2,organizations; ecology; social networks; social movements,SOCIAL-MOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS; NETWORKS; TIES; COMPETITION; DYNAMICS; NICHE; PARTICIPATION; MOBILIZATION; PERSPECTIVE; PERSISTENCE,88,1,1,6,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

We argue that rational and emotional styles of communication ebb and flow within public discussions about social problems due to the alternating influence of social contagion and saturation effects. These ""cognitive-emotional currents"" create an opportunity structure whereby advocacy organizations stimulate more conversation if they produce emotional messages after prolonged rational debate or vice versa. We test this hypothesis using automated text-analysis techniques that measure the frequency of cognitive and emotional language within two advocacy fields on Facebook over 1.5 years, and a web-based application that offered these organizations a complimentary audit of their social media outreach in return for sharing nonpublic data about themselves, their social media audiences, and the broader social context in which they interact.

To date, we have only limited knowledge about this essential representative process. In this article, we theorize and examine the signaling strength of one type of societal signal: protest. We do so by means of an innovative experiment conducted among Belgian national and regional politicians. Elected officials were exposed to manipulated television news items covering a protest demonstration. Following Tilly's previously untested WUNC claim, four features of the event were manipulated: the demonstrators' worthiness, unity, numerical strength, and commitment. We argue that these protest features present elected officials with useful cues about what (a segment of) the public wants. We find that these cues affect elected officials' beliefs. The salience they attach to the protest issue, the position they take, and their intended actions all change as a consequence of exposure. The size of a protest event (numbers) and whether the protesters agree among themselves (unity) are the most persuasive protest factors. The effects of the protest signals come on top of strong receiver effects.

Accordingly, the standard of living of the majority of southern European populaces has fallen significantly. Nevertheless, the dynamics of social contention in the form of strikes and demonstrations that accompany these experiences remain understudied. Why, in certain southern European countries, has collective upset arising from economic deprivation translated into frequent and large-scale contentious acts, while in others it has not? Drawing on the case of Cyprus from a comparative, southern European perspective, we seek to explain how relations within the party system, as well as between parties and civil society, can create the conditions that obstruct open social conflict.

AGENCY AND THE CAUSATION OF TRANSFORMATIVE EVENTS IN IRELAND'S 1916 RISING AND 1969 LONG MARCH,"This article investigates the role of agency in the causation of transformative events by looking at the competition between rival strands within social movements. The creative activity involved in the elaboration and execution of rival strategies is used as a proxy for agency. We present a paired comparison of two very different transformative events in twentieth-century Ireland-the Easter Rising of 1916 and the Long March from Belfast to Derry in 1969-and the strategic interactions preceding them. The comparison shows how agency and structure can interact around transformative events. High levels of agency were instrumental in making the events, and in turn these events catalyzed powerful social forces. These forces were structural-that is, they reflected divisions, tensions, and power relations that were deeply engrained in the social structure over the long term. However, these structural forces could have remained dormant had it not been for the bursts of agency that brought about the transformative events in question. We also see in these cases that the balance between structure and agency is dynamic, sometimes shifting from one moment to another rather than remaining constant.",MOBILIZATION,2017,22,2,,CIVIL-RIGHTS CAMPAIGN; SOCIAL-MOVEMENT; NORTHERN-IRELAND; MOBILIZATION; DYNAMICS; POLITICS,80,1,1,0,0,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SAN DIEGO,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA",1086-671X,,,MOBILIZATION,Mobilization,JUN,10.17813/1086-671X-22-2-223,FE9HR,WOS:000408515300005,1,1

Drawing on a quantitative protest event analysis that covers the period from 1995 to 2009 in Austria, France, Germany, Spain, and the UK, as well as in the sub-, supra- and transnational spheres (N = 1,865), it compares four pathways to Europeanization: domestication, externalization, supranationalization, and transnational pressure. It explains the relative prominence of these pathways through a general theory of movement behavior that is based on transaction costs and contextual opportunities and on the specifics of the EU's GM policy domain. It then examines alternatives to these standard predictions. While Europeanization is a multilevel process entailing national, sub-, supra- and transnational arenas, nation states remain the key arenas of movement for Europeanization, which is reinforced by the contentious nature of the GM policy domain.

However, recent studies indicate that in some cases, lifestyle activists engage in actions that target the state. This study investigates why some lifestyle activists combine these forms of engagement, while others do not. We explore whether such differences can be explained by variations in activists' perceptions of the political opportunity structure. In particular, we consider whether perceptions of input structures and output structures offer relevant predictors for combining lifestyle politics with state-oriented actions. The article presents an in-depth case study of a Belgian environmental lifestyle movement organization, using a mixed methods approach including participant observation, qualitative interviewing, and surveys.

We describe three distinct frame contraction processes, frame removal, frame minimization, and frame restriction, which characterize common frame contraction strategies. We illustrate frame contraction by examining the framing approaches used by the United Auto Workers as they bargained with automakers across two rounds of negotiations in 1945-46 and 1949-1950. We show how frame contraction articulates undertheorized complexities in changes to social movement frames.

Mediation, Rightist Movements, and Why US Movements Received Extensive Newspaper Coverage","Under which conditions do social movements receive coverage by the mainstream news media? News coverage matters for movements for political, cultural, and organizational reasons, but only rarely have scholars analyzed the coverage of movements comparatively and at the movement level. To address the question, we apply a political mediation model of the influence of movements to professional news media, using ideas from the social organization of the news perspective. From this model, we hypothesize four main multicausal paths to extensive coverage for movements. These involve the joint occurrence of two specific movement characteristics-disruptive capacities and extensive organization-and two specific political contexts-unified partisan regimes and enforced policies. Working from scholarship that argues that rightist movements have different determinants, we also devise hypotheses for their coverage. These hypotheses are appraised through qualitative comparative analyses on an updated Political Organizations in the News data set. The latter includes information on all the coverage of national US movement organizations in four major national newspapers across the twentieth century. These analyses provide extensive support for the mediation model and support claims that rightist movements have separate and in some ways more difficult routes to extensive news coverage.",SOCIAL FORCES,2017,96,2,,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; UNITED-STATES; POLITICAL MEDIATION; SELECTION BIAS; PUBLIC SPHERE; PROTEST; POLICY; AGENDA; MOBILIZATION; CONSEQUENCES,89,0,0,5,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,,SOC FORCES,Soc.

"Gibson, CL","Gibson, Christopher L.",The Consequences of Movement Office-Holding for Health Policy Implementation and Social Development in Urban Brazil,"Extensive scholarship addresses whether and how social movements can have consequences for outcomes of interest to them. Though divided in its conclusions, existing research generally shares a focus on potential contributions of movements to the codification of rights and adoption of policies, rather than their actual implementation. Often, however, palpable enactment of the crystallized laws and policies that movements demand is far from guaranteed, raising salient questions about whether and how movements can matter for implementation outcomes as well. To address such questions, the article uses a mixed-methods analysis to examine consequences of subnational office-holding by ""sanitarista"" activists from the Sanitarist Movement-contemporary Brazil's most important health movement-for rates of primary public health coverage and childhood mortality. Before reviewing existing theories and conceptualizing movement office-holding, it briefly describes the movement's role in codifying Brazil's constitutional right to health and demanding new local democratic institutions for enacting that right. Then, Prais-Winsten regression analyses of all major Brazilian capitals between 1995 and 2014 show that sanitarista office-holding atop a key subnational institution was associated with broader health service coverage and lower mortality. Comparative case-study analysis illustrates that office-holding sanitaristas helped generate these improvements by leveraging new democratic offices to marshal support of subnational executives for the movement's modest but effective state-building project in the municipal health sector. Ultimately, theories of movement consequences benefit from considering how in certain democratic contexts, subnational office-holding can constitute an important standalone outcome with considerable promise to also improve policy implementation and social development.",SOCIAL FORCES,2017,96,2,sociology of development; political sociology; social movements; health; global & transnational sociology,CROSS-SECTION-DATA; POLITICAL PROTEST; INFANT-MORTALITY; DEMOCRACIES; IMPACT; ANTINUCLEAR; OUTCOMES; PROGRAM,49,0,0,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,,SOC FORCES,Soc.

I draw on the sociology of labor to argue that unions use non-market sources of power to pressure companies into raising wages. This theory of union power implies a new test of union wage effects: does union activism have an effect on wages that is not reducible to workers' market position? Two institutional determinants of union activity are used to empirically isolate the wage effect of union activism from labor market conditions: increased union revenue from investment shocks and increased union activity leading up to union officer elections. Instrumental variable analysis of panel data from the Department of Labor shows that a 1 percent increase in union spending increases a proxy for union members' wages between 0.15 percent and 0.30 percent. These wage effects are larger in years of active collective bargaining, and when unions increase spending in ways that could pressure companies. The results indicate that non-market sources of union power can affect workers' wages and that even in a period of labor weakness unions still play a role in setting wages for their members.",SOCIAL FORCES,2017,95,4,,INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; POSITIONAL POWER; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; PRIVATE-SECTOR; AMERICAN LABOR; STRIKES; UNIONIZATION; INEQUALITY; OUTCOMES; IMPACTS,74,1,1,12,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,,SOC FORCES,Soc.

Pro-immigrant activists in this study contended that the problem of undocumented migration resulted from the state's unchecked coercive power. Experiencing this strong-state effect, pro-immigrant activists' tactics focused on limiting the state's reach and reinforcing society's capacity to resist the state. Meanwhile, immigration restrictionist activists attributed the problem of undocumented immigration to the state's feebleness as a policing entity. In response to this weak-state effect, restrictionist tactics tried to expand the state's scope and build society's ability to aid the state.

How Partisan Political Blogs Legitimize the Tea Party Movement and Occupy Wall Street,"Social movements struggle to gain acceptance as legitimate actors so that they can raise money, recruit members, and convince politicians to meet their demands. We know little, however, about how this legitimacy is granted by various political authorities, in part because legitimacy is often poorly operationalized. To operationalize legitimacy, I revise Charles Tilly's (1999) classic concept of WUNC displays (i.e., public presentations of worthiness, unity, numbers, commitment) to assess how political authorities legitimize social movements. I analyze original data on the coverage the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street received from 20 elite political blogs during a critical event early in each movement's development. I find that liberal and conservative blogs both use the same aspects of worthiness (and not unity, numbers, or commitment) to endorse their preferred movement but different aspects of unworthiness to denounce the movement they opposed. Conservative outlets were more partisan on both accounts. This suggests that these blogs' shared status as distinctly partisan political outsiders produces a similar, but not identical, relationship with social movements. While both sets of blogs legitimize and delegitimize a movement based on its specific strengths and weaknesses, conservative blogs act more as a partisan bullhorn and liberal blogs act more as a forum for debate.",SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,2017,32,2,legitimation; Occupy Wall Street; partisan media; politics; social movements; Tea Party,MEDIA COVERAGE; PROTEST; NEWS; POLARIZATION; MAINSTREAM; NEWSPAPERS; DISCOURSE; AGENDA; PRINT,51,0,0,3,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

Results show that social movements depend a lot on other political actors to gain media visibility for their messages.

Consistent with this reasoning, they have shown that from the middle of the last century up through the mid-1990s, nations with more memberships in NGOs have tended to have lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the aggregate. Doubts remain, however, about whether NGOs have reduced emissions in the time since and at the level of individual power plants where the lion's share of carbon pollution is emitted. Using plant-specific information on CO2 emissions recently collected by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, we investigate the effects of local environmental NGOs (ENGOs) on plants' environmental performance. Consistent with our expectations, we find that local ENGOs not only directly reduce plants' emissions but indirectly do so by enhancing the effectiveness of subnational climate policies that encourage energy efficiency.

"Bjorklund, E","Bjorklund, Eric",Just One Click Away: The Politics of E-Commerce Sales Tax Policy,"E-commerce has altered the relationship between consumers, businesses, and U. S. states. E-retailers are not required to collect sales tax from their customers, thus depriving fiscally insecure states of tax revenue, and providing a competitive advantage for eretailers, like Amazon Inc., in their struggle for market share with brick-and-mortar stores, like Walmart. Attempts at e-commerce sales tax policy by state legislators and brick-and-mortar lobbyists failed until 2008 when New York successfully passed legislation. A subsequent wave of legislation ensued, and between 2008 and 2012, e-commerce sales tax legislation left committee in fourteen states, each experiencing various levels of success. Existing explanatory efforts have not fully accounted for the combinatorial effect of political-institutional structure and market contestation in U. S. state-level policy creation, as well as the likelihood of multiple pathways to passage. Embracing this framework, I use fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to uncover three sufficient pathways for successful passage of e-commerce sales tax policy.

"Rafail, P; Freitas, I","Rafail, Patrick; Freitas, Isaac","Permeable Participation: Civic Engagement and Protest Mobilization in 20 OECD Countries, 1981-2008","Civic engagement and protest mobilization have generally been treated as distinct activities, with separate literatures examining each form of participation. This differentiation largely rests on the political nature of protest, which is treated as inconsistent with more apolitical civic engagement. We argue that the boundaries between protest participation and civic engagement became more permeable over time. We link this to consistency in the profiles of individuals who become engaged and the institutionalization of protest, which expanded the participatory base of protest to new groups. Using four waves of the European and World Values Survey, we analyze 78,524 individuals from 20 member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Results from a multilevel multinomial logistic regression analysis demonstrate that while there have been modest increases in protesting and civic engagement over time, individuals participating in both types of activities have experienced the most growth, consistent with our argument.",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,2017,60,3,protest participation; civic engagement; volunteerism; World Values Survey,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; UNITED-STATES; STUDENT PROTEST; ACTIVISM; ORGANIZATIONS; EDUCATION; SOCIETY; GLOBALIZATION; GENERATION; SUPPORT,61,0,0,4,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0731-1214,1533-8673,,SOCIOL PERSPECT,Sociol.

"Ward, M","Ward, Matthew","Opportunity, Resources, and Threat: Explaining Local Nativist Organizing in the United States","I examine variation in nativist organizing through an analysis of the number of nativist organizations in U.S. counties. I make two primary contributions to literatures on anti-immigrant phenomena and right-wing mobilization. First, I investigate the extent to which theories of threat, in addition to resource mobilization and political opportunity theories, further our understandings of nativist mobilization. Pro-immigrant oppositional activism and racist hate resource and organizational bases facilitate this mobilization, whereas a weak economic base, growing working-class base, and increasing Latino political representation constrain it. In addition, the association between nativist mobilization and Latino population change, as well as conservative voting, is curvilinear (inverted U). Nativist mobilization thrives in the presence of low-to-moderate levels of demographic threat, as well as in contexts in which political conservatism is present but weak enough to make the conservative, nativist identity nonnormative. Second, few studies examine nonattitudinal or noninstitutionalized anti-immigrant phenomena. There is little understanding of whether or not social structures facilitating anti-immigrant attitudes and institutionalized anti-immigrant activity similarly influence the presence of anti-immigrant mobilization. Although results suggest that political and cultural threats shape diverse anti-immigrant phenomena, I also point to a unique set of structural conditions beyond threat to explain nativist mobilization in particular.",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,2017,60,3,anti-immigrant; minuteman; mobilization; nativism; social movement; immigrant,MOVEMENTS; DETERMINANTS; IMMIGRATION; PROTEST; LAWS,63,0,0,2,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0731-1214,1533-8673,,SOCIOL PERSPECT,Sociol.

"Savio, G","Savio, Gianmarco",Organization and Stigma Management: A Comparative Study of Dumpster Divers in New York,"Scholarly work has discussed the ways in which stigmatized groups may resist their stigma, along with various resources at their disposal that facilitate such resistance. However, it has not explicitly considered how organization can serve as one such resource. Bringing into dialogue scholarly work on stigma, organizations, and social movements, this article examines the role of organization as a key resource for managing and resisting stigma. In doing so, it draws from a comparative analysis of two groups of dumpster divers in New York City. It finds that whereas informal social organization allowed one group to develop shared views regarding the practice, formal collective organization enabled another group to confront the stigma itself. The findings therefore highlight the role of organization in both mitigating shared stigma and challenging its basis-thereby providing insights into the social conditions of stigma management and the collective resources at the disposal of stigmatized groups.",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,2017,60,2,stigma; organization; social movements; dumpster diving; group dynamics,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; RESISTANCE; IDENTITIES; ILLNESS,49,0,0,4,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0731-1214,1533-8673,,SOCIOL PERSPECT,Sociol.

"Estep, K","Estep, Kevin",Constructing a Language Problem: Status-based Power Devaluation and the Threat of Immigrant Inclusion,"Opposition to immigrant inclusion is often grounded in a Latino threat narrative that portrays Latino immigrants and their descendants as incapable of assimilation and undeserving of the benefits of citizenship. Are nativist reactions to this narrative strongest where immigrants are lagging behind in cultural assimilation, or where they are actually making the greatest gains? Two competing logics of status threat are tested through an analysis of county-level voting returns on California's Proposition 227. Status politics theories predict higher antibilingual support where immigrants are failing to learn English. In contrast, the status devaluation argument leads to the counterintuitive prediction that support should be highest where language assimilation rates are high. Although we might expect that the claims of the Latino threat narrative would be least appealing where objective circumstances refute them, findings suggest that the resonance of such claims can be amplified in settings where they are furthest from the truth. The theoretical argument advanced helps explain why nativist policies continue to generate broad appeal at a time when immigrants are rapidly assimilating.",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,2017,60,3,immigration; assimilation; Latino threat; social movements; power devaluation; status politics; language politics; nativism,ANTI-IMMIGRANT; UNITED-STATES; MOVEMENT; POLITICS; PREJUDICE; ATTITUDES; EUROPE; POLICY; MOBILIZATION; EXPLANATIONS,61,0,0,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0731-1214,1533-8673,,SOCIOL PERSPECT,Sociol.

Attitudes of the German Public toward America and Americans","The article examines the causes and social mechanisms of anti-American attitudes and behavior and illustrates the fruitfulness of this theoretical approach using the example of Germany. We argue that anti-American attitudes are rooted mainly in two sociopsychological functions: the rationalization of social change and the projection of self-parts that have been suppressed. Other determinants are social norms, lack of personal social contact with Americans, and a strong national identity. Further, we also investigate the correlation between anti-American attitudes and behavioral intentions. Using a national sample (n = 1,201) and a comprehensive measure of anti-Americanism, we document the distribution of perceptions about America and Americans among the German population and explore the explanatory power of the theoretical concepts.",SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY,2017,58,2,Collective behavior and social movements; global and transnational society; peace; war; and social conflict,FOREIGN-POLICY; BEHAVIOR; IRAQ,92,0,0,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-0253,1533-8525,,SOCIOL QUART,Sociol.

To reduce this bias, I demonstrate how the personal sphere can be prefigurative. An analysis of woman's temperance and woman's suffrage newspaper articles about cooking reveals that these activists advocated cooking in ways that would prefigure their visions of social change within individual families. Therefore, this article broadens the concept of prefigurative politics beyond organizations, expanding it to the home.

Through a case study of London protests, this article transcends these limitations by articulating a social ecological approach consisting of critical ethnography and autoethnography that unearth the organizational strategies and symbolic representations exchanged among police, protesters, and third-party observers, while mapping the physical and symbolic characteristics of space bearing on these interactions. This approach points to a conceptualization of power at work as transient, typological structures: (a) rooted in collective agency; (b) both mediating and mediated by symbolic representations; (c) whose sensibilities are determined by symbolic interpretations; and (d) thrown into binary opposition between protester power and police power, who mutually represent meanings to resist and be resisted by.",SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY,2017,58,3,Collective behavior and social movements; community and urban sociology; social psychology; theory; methodology; political sociology,SYMBOLIC INTERACTIONISM; RESOURCE MOBILIZATION; SUNFLOWER MOVEMENT; IDENTITY; PROTEST; SPACES; AGENCY,71,0,0,6,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-0253,1533-8525,,SOCIOL QUART,Sociol.
